<h2 title="PREFACE"><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>

<p class="new_para">Under the heading of ‘The Varieties of English Speech’
an article of mine appeared in <cite>The Quarterly Review</cite> of
July, 1907. The favourable reception accorded to it at the
time prompted me to embark forthwith on a larger work
dealing with the same subject.</p>

<p class="new_para">Many books both scientific and popular have been written
concerning dialect speech and lore, but nearly all of them
are special investigations of some particular dialect. I have
taken a bolder flight than this. I have not given a detailed
account of any one dialect, but I have surveyed them all,
and have gathered words, phrases, names, superstitions, and
popular customs, here and there, wherever I found something
that appealed to me, and that I felt would appeal to others
as well as myself. It was impossible to make any one
category exhaustive, for such was the mass of material open
to me for selection, I might say I was ‘fairly betwattled and
baffounded’. The only thing to be done was to make my
selections fairly representative of the whole.</p>

<p class="new_para">My aim in dealing with the linguistic side of my subject
has been to show that rules for pronunciation and syntax
are not the monopoly of educated people who have been
taught to preach as well as practise them. Dialect-speaking
people obey sound-laws and grammatical rules even more
faithfully than we do, because theirs is a natural and unconscious
obedience. Some writers of literary English seem to
enjoy flinging jibes at dialect on the assumption that any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>
deviation from the standard speech must be due to ignorance,
if not to vulgarity besides. Since I wrote the last chapter
of this book, I read in a criticism of Stanley Houghton’s
Play <cite>Trust the People</cite>, this sentence describing the Lancashire
‘father an old mill-hand and the homely mother to match’:
‘They are both drawn, you feel, to the life, and talk with
ease, not to say gusto, that curious lingo which seems to an
outsider mainly distinguished by its contemptuous neglect of
the definite article’, <cite>The Times</cite>, Friday, <abbr title="February">Feb.</abbr>&nbsp;7, 1913. Now
the definite article in north-west Lancashire is <em>t</em>, in the
south-west and south <em>t</em>, or <em>th</em>, and in mid and south-east
Lancashire <em>th</em>. When this <em>t</em> stands before a consonant, and
more especially before a dental such as <em>t</em>, <em>d</em>, it is not by any
means easy for the uninitiated to detect the difference in
sound between the simple word and the same word preceded
by the article, between, for example, <em>table</em> and <em>t table</em>, or <em>dog</em>
and <em>t dog</em>. But this is not ‘contemptuous neglect’ on the
part of the Lancastrian! It would be nearer the mark to
say that the Lancashire dialect is characterized by its
retention of a form of the definite article very difficult to
pronounce in certain combinations.</p>

<p class="new_para">Further, I have endeavoured to show by means of numerous
illustrations, how full the dialects are of words and phrases
remarkable not only for their force and clearness, but often
also for their subtle beauty, that satisfying beauty of the
thing exactly fitted to its purpose.</p>

<p class="new_para">I have also drawn up lists showing the numbers of old
words and phrases once common in English literature, still
existing in the dialects. Occasionally writers of modern
verse seek to restore some of the words of this type to their
former position in literary English, thereby causing the
reviewer to stumble dreadfully, though he thinketh he
standeth. I quote the following from a literary periodical
dated May&nbsp;2, 1913: ‘He [the poet] debates if he shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</a></span>
make “a nest within a reedy brake”, or, failing this
delectable situation, offers himself a quaint alternative,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="p_line">Or I shall see with quiet eye,</div>
    <div class="p_line">The dappled paddock loping by.</div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p class="cont">We had always supposed in our ignorance that “paddock”
was a term applied to green fields or pastures. How Mr. ...
could have seen a paddock “lope” we do not know, and
perhaps it would not be kind to ask him to explain.’ The
majority of educated people are familiar with the word
<em>paddock</em>, a toad, or a frog, from its occurrence in the
opening lines of <cite>Macbeth</cite>, and in Herrick’s <cite>Child’s Grace</cite>,
but it will probably never again take its former place in the
standard speech, though it may remain very common in
the dialects.</p>

<p class="new_para">In the chapters devoted to folk-lore I have not attempted
to do more than chronicle certain superstitions and popular
beliefs, leaving to my readers the fascinating pursuit of
tracing superstitions to their sources, and of bringing to light
hidden grains of truth in apparently silly beliefs. There is
here plenty of scope both for scholarship and imagination.
I once happened to mention at a dinner-party the superstition
that it is a sure presage of a parting for an engaged couple
to stand as fellow sponsors at a baptism. My neighbour,
who was a clergyman, immediately explained the reason for
this idea by telling me that in pre-Reformation days godparents
were not allowed to marry each other. The Church
recognized a sort of spiritual affinity between such persons,
which precluded lawful marriage. It is strange to think
that while joining in a Protestant service to-day, members of
the Church of England are still swayed by an old law they
never heard of except as it exists in the word ‘unlucky’.</p>

<p class="new_para">In dealing with popular customs I have selected those that
are less well known, and others concerning which I have
myself collected information, and have omitted many which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
are readily accessible in works such as Hone’s <cite>Year Book</cite>
and Chambers’s <cite>Book of Days</cite>.</p>

<p class="new_para">I may mention that in collecting my material from very
many miscellaneous sources, printed and oral, I have not
felt justified in normalizing the orthography of the dialect
quotations, especially where these have been taken from
glossaries. This accounts for a certain amount of inconsistency
in the orthography.</p>

<p class="new_para">At the end of the table of contents will be found a select
list of the works which I have found most useful in writing
this book.</p>

<h2 title="INTRODUCTION"><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p class="new_para">Among common errors still persisting in the minds of
educated people, one error which dies very hard is the theory
that a dialect is an arbitrary distortion of the mother tongue,
a wilful mispronunciation of the sounds, and disregard of the
syntax of a standard language. Only quite recently—May&nbsp;5,
1910—in reviewing a book called <cite>The Anglo-Irish
Language</cite>, a writer in the <cite>Times Literary Supplement</cite> says:
‘The Anglo-Irish dialect is a passably good name for it ...,
but it is something more than a dialect, more than an affair
of Pidgin English, bad spelling, provincialisms, and preposterous
grammar.’ Here we have a very good modern
instance of the old error. A dialect, we are to understand,
consists of ‘Pidgin English, bad spelling, provincialisms, and
preposterous grammar’. This comes of reading dialect
stories by authors who have no personal knowledge of any
dialect whatever, and who have never studied any language
scientifically. All they have done, perhaps, is to have
purchased the Dialect Glossary of some district, or maybe
they have asked a friend to supply a little local colouring.
A lady once wrote to the Secretary of the English Dialect
Society as follows: ‘Dear Sir, a friend of mine intends
writing a novel, the scene of which is to be laid in Essex in
the sixteenth century. Will you kindly give her a few hints
as to the local dialect of that period?’ Authors of this type
put into the mouths of their dialect-speaking characters
a kind of doggerel which the above definition aptly describes,
their readers then run away with the idea that this hotch-potch
is the ‘spit and image’ of a real, living, English
dialect. As a matter of fact, our English dialects exemplify
so well the sound-laws of living speech, and the historical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span>
development of an originally inflected language, that the
Neuphilologen in Germany are calling for Dialect Reading
Books for German students studying English. A Professor
in the University of Giessen has just bought fifty copies of
Wright’s <cite>Grammar of the English Dialects</cite> for his Seminar.
Now and then a solitary German student is sent over to
England to encamp in a remote country village and write
a learned Dissertation on the characteristic vowel-sounds of
the district; an arduous task for a young foreigner whose
knowledge of literary English as she is spoke is an uncertain
quantity. But the field of English dialects offers other
allurements besides those which attract the philologist and
the grammarian. The language-specialist merely digs and
quarries, as it were, in the bare soil and rock, where he finds
rich ores amply sufficient to repay his pains and toil, but
there remains plenty of room for the rest of us who are less
laboriously inclined, and at every turn are enticing paths.
The real charm lies in the fact that it is a ‘faire felde ful of
folke’, natural, homely, witty folk. If this book succeeds in
pointing out a few of the many ways in which the study of
our English dialects may not only contribute to the advancement
of knowledge, but also give us a clearer insight into
the life and character of the British peasant and artisan, it
will have achieved the aim and object of its existence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
Insignificance of London
</div>

<p class="new_para">With the spread of education, and the ever-increasing
means of rapid locomotion throughout the length and
breadth of the land, the area where pure dialects are spoken
is lessening year by year. It used to be Mam and Dad and
Porridge, and then ’twas Father and Mother and Broth,
but now ’tis Pa and Ma and Soup, is a saying concerning
farmers’ children in the Midlands. In the words of an old
North-country woman: T’young ’uns dizn’t talk noo leyke
what they did when ah wer a lass; there’s ower mich o’ this
knackin’ [affected talk] noo; bud, as ah tells ’em, fooaks
spoils thersens sadly wi’ knackin’. An’ then there’s another
thing, when deean, they can mak nowt bud mashelshon
[mixed corn] on’t. There is a very old proverb in Cheshire,
applied to any one who goes out of the country for improvement,
and returns without having gained much; such a one
is said to have ‘been at London to learn to call a streea
a straw’. It is not often now that one could hear it said:
Ah deean’t gan bauboskin’ [straying away] aboot leyke sum
on ’em, ah sticks ti t’heeaf. The place where a mountain
or fell sheep is born, and where it continues to live and
pasture, is called its <em>heaf</em>, and the word is often in the
Northern counties thus picturesquely used in a figurative
sense. When one looks at the placards announcing in large
letters the extraordinarily cheap day trips offered by the
Great Western or the Midland Railway, or sees hoardings
decorated with garish posters portraying the arid sands and
cloudless skies of Blackpool or Morecambe, how dim and
distant seem those past days when in their stead he who runs
might read an advertisement such as this: ‘The York four-days
Stage Coach begins on Friday the 12th of April. All that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
are desirous to pass from London to York, or from York to
London, or any other place on that road, let them repair
to the Black Swan in Holborn, or to the Black Swan in Conney
Street in York, at both which places they may be received
in a Stage Coach every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday,
which performs the whole journey in four days (if God
permits), and sets forth at five in the morning.’ Small
wonder if people then stuck to their heaf, and dialects
remained pure and unadulterated. But even to-day one
can still find country places where our great cities are
known only by name. The inhabitants may ask us casually:
Hoo’s traade doon London waay?—but you feel, in so doing,
they merely wish to make polite conversation. Two or
three years ago we lunched at a small village inn not far from
Skipton in Yorkshire, and before leaving the landlord
asked us to write our names in his visitors’ book. When
we had finished, he read over the entry, and said, ‘Ah, you
come from Oxford, perhaps you know London?’ ‘Oh,
yes,’ we said, ‘we go to London sometimes.’ ‘Then you’ll
happen know my brother,’ was the confident rejoinder.
This last summer we stayed at a most primitive inn—with
a courtesy title of Hotel—on the moors under the shadow
of Penyghent. The landlord fetched us and our luggage
from the station, and as he was uncording a box of books
he observed, ‘You come from Oxford then.’ ‘Yes,’ said I,
feeling proud of my connexion with that ancient Seat of
Learning. ‘Oh!’ said mine host of the Golden Lion,
‘How’s hay down there?’</p>

<div class="sidenote">
The Yorkshire Bite
</div>

<p class="new_para">To gain the full benefit and enjoyment of a sojourn in
a country village, it is an immense advantage to be able to
speak the dialect yourself, or at any rate to be able to
understand and respect it. That is why we prefer the West
Riding of Yorkshire to any other part of England, for there
we are at home with the native, and are not looked upon
as ‘foreigners’.
The name Yorkshire has become a synonym
for acuteness not unmixed with a touch of unscrupulousness.
In Lincolnshire, for example, when anything is done which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
is very clever, sharp, or unscrupulous, they say: That’s
real Yerksheer. To put Yorkshire on a person means in
Lancashire to cheat, trick, or overreach him; in Lancashire
and Lincolnshire a sharp overreaching person is called
a Yorkshire bite. Even in his own country the Yorkshireman
has this reputation. It was a native who told us the
following story. Two Yorkshiremen, whom we will call
A. and B., were accustomed to send their horses to the same
Show. A.’s horse always won prizes, and B.’s never did.
One day B. complained to A. ‘I can’t think why Mr. So-and-so
(the judge) never gives me a First Prize; my horse
is every bit as good as yours.’ ‘Well,’ said A., ‘I tell you
what you had better do before the next Show; you send
Mr. So-and-so a good big ham.’ The day came, and this
time it was B.’s horse that won the First Prize. A. was
both angry and astonished. He went to B. and asked:
‘Did you send that ham?’ ‘Yes,’ said B., ‘but I sent it
in your name, not mine.’ Another Yorkshireman on his
death-bed found satisfaction in the thought that he had
outwitted an Insurance Company. ‘Ah’ve dun ’em, Joe,
ah’ve dun ’em. T’doctor says ah’m bahn [I am going] to
dee, an’ ah wor nobbud insiured six munths sin,’ he boasted
to a sympathizing friend. It would, however, be grossly
unfair to judge the Yorkshireman on the strength of this
proverbial characteristic. He has very many other qualities
equally characteristic and much more desirable, but
which become famed in phrase and story only when found
in an exaggerated form, as for instance the tenacity of purpose
shown by that celebrated <em>Yorkshire Oddity</em> William Sharp,
popularly known as Old Three Laps, who died in the year
1856. When a young man of thirty he became engaged to
be married. The wedding-day was fixed, but when the
appointed hour came, only the bridegroom appeared in
church. At the last moment the bride’s father, dissatisfied
about the marriage settlements, refused to allow his
daughter to marry the man of her choice. The disappointed
bridegroom returned to his home, went to bed, and vowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
he would stay there, and never speak again to any one. He
kept his word up to the time of his death, forty-nine years
later, when he is said to have exclaimed shortly before his
end, ‘Poor Bill! poor Bill! poor Bill Sharp!’ A Yorkshireman
has a very strong sense of his own dignity, and some
‘South-country’ people mistake his attitude of independence
for impertinence, and because he will not brook a condescending
manner or a dictatorial speech, and because he
says exactly what he means, they style him rude. Many
stories are told of a certain grocer in Settle noted for his
treatment of impertinent customers. A lady one day walked
into his shop and inquired very abruptly: ‘What are eggs
to-day?’ ‘Eggs,’ was the prompt reply. At Kettlewell
once a man and his wife, evidently on a cycling tour from
‘down South’, came into the inn, and demanded tea in
such peremptory tones, that the landlady turned her back
on them, and we heard them muttering: ‘She’s bound to
give us something.’ If you want to be well served at a
Yorkshire inn, the first thing to do is to take note of the
name over the door before you cross the threshold; then you
can address the landlady as ‘Mrs. Atkinson’ (pronounced
<em>Atkisson</em>), for you will need her name constantly, if you
wish your conversation to be agreeable to her. ‘Down
South’ we are very chary in our use of proper names in
conversation; we can talk to an acquaintance or a friend
by the hour addressing him only as ‘you’. In the North,
we should intersperse our remarks freely with ‘Mr. Brown’
if he is an acquaintance, or ‘John’ if he is a friend. It is
a noticeable fact that in the North men call each other by
their Christian names, where in the South they would use the
surname without the formal Mr. But to return to inns.
Having duly passed the time of day with the landlady, you
will next have to converse with her serving-maid, whose
name has yet to be discovered. We have adopted a plan of
addressing her always as ‘Mary’, till she gives us better
information. The last damsel we thus met told us her
name was Dinah, and further, that she was ‘a Lancashire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
lass’. In Yorkshire if you ask a person his or her name you
must say: ‘What do they call you?’ You might not be
understood if you said: ‘What is your name?’ The first
question in the Catechism has often met with no response
other than a vacant stare from children in Sunday Schools.
A story is told of a clergyman near Whitby who went one
day into the village school, and seeing a new face among
the boys, said: ‘Well, my lad, and who are you?’ Boy:
‘Aw, ah’s middlin’; hoo’s yoursen?’</p>

<div class="sidenote">
Tea in the Parlour
</div>

<p class="new_para">The Kettlewell landlady was so charmed by our greeting,
and our use of her name and her dialect, that on our very
first visit she treated us to her old family silver tea-spoons,
and on the next occasion we not only had the tea-spoons, but
we had a real old Queen Anne silver teapot as well, and
a perfect feast of cakes, laid out in the private parlour
where the foot of the tripper never trod. We came upon an
inn full of trippers once, and though we were shown to a seat
at a table, we could get no further attention, for nobody
seemed to have time to fetch us any lunch. At last we secured
the ear of the daughter of the house, and we pleaded our
cause in her native tongue, whereupon she quickly fetched
her parents, and the table was laid, and spread with ample
fare in the twinkling of an eye.</p>

<p class="new_para">In a seventeenth-century Tract—<cite>Of Recreations</cite>—in which
are put forth the delights of ‘riding with a good horse
and a good companion, in the spring or summer season,
into the country’, the author goes on to tell us: ‘And if
you happen, as often it falleth out, to converse with countrymen
of the place; you shall find them, for the most part,
understanding enough to give you satisfaction: and sometimes
country maids and market wenches will give as
unhappy answers as they be asked knavish and uncivil
questions. Others there be, who, out of their rustical
simplicity, will afford you matter of mirth, if you stay to
talk with them.’</p>

<span class="sub_head">RICH AND EXPRESSIVE VOCABULARY</span></h2>

<p class="new_para">It is generally supposed that the vocabulary of dialect-speaking
people is very small; indeed, it has been stated
as a scientific fact that the common rustic uses scarcely
more than 300 words. The most cursory glance at the
<cite>English Dialect Dictionary</cite>, however, will suffice to convince
anybody that this statement is incorrect. The six volumes
of this Dictionary contain in all over 5,000 pages, and the
number of simple and compound words in the first volume
(A-C) is 17,519; and from the careful statistics given of
the contents of this volume, it may safely be inferred that
the whole Dictionary contains over 100,000 words.</p>

<p class="new_para">As may be expected, we find in this vocabulary an immense
variety of terms or phrases for expressing one and the
same idea. For instance, there are approximately 1,350
words meaning to give a person a thrashing, and an almost
innumerable quantity meaning to die, and to get drunk.
There are some 1,300 ways of telling a person he is a fool. A
few names taken at random are: chuffin head, coof, gapus,
gauvison, goostrumnoodle, Jerry pattick, mee-maw, ning-nang,
nornigig, rockey-codlin, Sammy-suck-egg, snool,
stooky, Tom-coddy, yawney, yonnack. A fine cumulative
effect is produced by a few introductory adjectives, with
or without a final pronoun, in such personal remarks as:
Thoo goffeny goavey, it’s thoo at’s daft Watty; You
drumble-drone, dunder-headed slinpole; Thah gert, gawmless,
sackless, headed fooil thah. There are about 1,050
terms for a slattern, such as: daffock, dawps, drazzle-drozzle,
flammakin, hagmahush, lirrox, mad Moll o’ the woods,
mawkin, moggy, rubbacrock, slammock or slommocks, trail-tengs,
trash-mire, wally-draigle.</p>

<p class="new_para">Among animals possessing a large variety of names the
smallest pig of a litter holds a very prominent place with
over 120 titles to distinction, such as: Anthony-pig, cadme,
Daniel, dilling (a very old word for <em>darling</em>, occurring in
Cotgrave’s <cite>Dictionary</cite> and Burton’s <cite>Anatomy of Melancholy</cite>),
greck, little Josey, Nicholas, nisgal, pedman, ritling, runt,
squab, treseltrype, wrenock. That handsome bird the
hickwall, or green woodpecker, <span class="sci_name">Gecinus viridis</span>, figures under
almost every letter of the alphabet; whilst the sparrow and
the stickleback also rank high on the list. Among flowers,
the ox-eye daisy and the foxglove have the largest number
of different names. The foxglove is called: fairy fingers,
fairy glove, fairy petticoats, fairy thimbles, witches’ thimbles,
bloody man’s fingers, dead man’s bells, flop-a-dock, poppy-dock,
pop-guns, <abbr class="silent" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, <abbr class="silent" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> One would fain find in Thormantle,
or Thor’s-mantle, a trace of ancient mythology, but
the most probable explanation of the term is that it is a
corruption of <em>tormentil</em> from <span class="sci_name">Potentilla Tormentilla</span>, a flower
which shares with the foxglove the name Thor’s-mantle.</p>

Names for a Girl

The East Anglian Bor
</div>

<p class="new_para">One of the most comprehensive terms of familiar address
is the East Anglian <em>bor</em>, applied to persons of either sex and
of all ages, e.g. Hullo, bor! where be you a’goin? The
plural is <em>together</em>, e.g. Well, together, how are ye all? <em>Bor</em>
is an old native word, <abbr title="Old English">O.E.</abbr> <em><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">būr</span></em>, which we have in the literary
language as the second element in <em>neighbour</em>. How convenient
it would be if we could adopt <em>bor</em> into the upper
circles of the spoken language, for use at those awkward
moments when, after a lapse of years, we unexpectedly find
ourselves face to face with an old acquaintance, whose name
has slipped from our memories. How openly cordial we
could be, and at the same time so comfortably ambiguous:
And is it really you, bor? How glad I am to see you again!
But if we were to attempt to lay a plundering hand on the
dialects with intent to enrich our standard speech by handy
and convenient dialect words, we should be embarrassed by
the wealth before us. What literary word, for instance,
conveys the full meaning of the common dialect term <em>feckless</em>
(<abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr> <abbr title="Northumberland">Nhb.</abbr> <abbr title="Durham">Dur.</abbr> <abbr title="Cumberland">Cum.</abbr> <abbr title="Westmorland">Wm.</abbr> <abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr> <abbr title="Lancashire">Lan.</abbr> <abbr title="Warwickshire">War.</abbr>), the lineal descendant
of Shakespeare’s <em><span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">effectless</span></em>? It means: incapable,
incompetent, without resource, shiftless, helpless, and a great
deal more besides, all in a handy nutshell. There are scores
of adjectives, the forceful individuality of which we instinctively
feel, and yet find very hard to convey in the terms
of a verbal definition. We are driven to string together
inadequate synonyms, or pile up pedantic phrases. <em>A
feckless body</em> we define as: a person incapable of any effective
effort; <em>waughy</em> (<abbr title="north Country">n.Cy.</abbr>), we say, is used in illness, nearly
always during convalescence, to express the feebleness,
shakiness, and light-headedness after confinement to bed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
It also means weak in body, especially when accompanied by
a tendency to faint, e.g. I felt that waffy, I should hev siled
doon upo’ th’floor, if missis hedn’t gen me sum brandy.
<em>Chuff</em> (<abbr title="north Country">n.Cy.</abbr> <abbr title="north Midlands">n.Midl.</abbr> <abbr title="Midlands">Midl.</abbr>) is proud, pleased, denoting a
combination of fussiness and serene self-satisfaction. We
certainly have here much meaning in little room, as Dr.
Johnson found in the word <em>shrew</em>, which he defines as:
‘A peevish, malignant, clamorous, spiteful, vexatious,
turbulent woman.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">
A gradely Lass
</div>

<p class="new_para">A few words such as <em>canny</em>, <em>dour</em>, <em>pawky</em>, have gained a
recognized position in the standard speech, through having
been introduced by educated Scotchmen. Some of the
meanings of <em>canny</em> are expressed in the adjective <em>gradely</em>, a
word generally quoted as characteristic of the Lancashire
dialect, in the phrase <em>a gradely lass</em>. It belongs, however,
also to <abbr title="Cumberland">Cum.</abbr> <abbr title="Westmorland">Wm.</abbr> <abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr> <abbr title="Cheshire">Chs.</abbr> <abbr title="Staffordshire">Stf.</abbr> <abbr title="Derbyshire">Der.</abbr> <abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr> In origin it is a
form of <em>graithly</em>, a Scandinavian word, <abbr title="Old Norse">O.N.</abbr> <em><span lang="non" xml:lang="non">greiðligr</span></em>, ready,
prompt, and it can mean: (1) respectable, honest, (2) handsome,
comely, (3) friendly, kind, (4) clever, (5) having full
possession of one’s senses, (6) genuine, good, (7) considerable,
big. A similarly compact word in general dialect use
throughout Scotland and England is <em>jannock</em>, or <em>jonnock</em>;
like <em>gradely</em>, also of Scandinavian origin, <abbr title="compare">cp.</abbr> <abbr title="Norwegian dialect">Norw. dial.</abbr>
<em><span lang="no" xml:lang="no">jamn</span></em>, even, level, of which <em>jannock</em> is apparently a derivative
form. The commonest meaning is fair, honest, straight-forward:
Yü may trist she. I tellee ’er’s jonnick tü tha
back-bone (<abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr>). Another attractive adjective in general
dialect use is <em>peart</em>, a delightful word, which positively
sounds: brisk, lively, spirited, cheerful, in good health,
sharp, and intelligent. It has nothing to do with <em>pert</em> either
in form or meaning. It is used specially of persons just
recovered from an illness, e.g. Pretty peart again now—but
it may also be used of animals and plants. We may remark:
Them onions look peart, in contemplating the onion-bed. A common proverbial saying in Cheshire is: Poor and peart
like the parson’s pig, whereby hangs a tale. The proverb is
traced back to the days when the parson had to take some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
at least of his tithe in kind, when the pig reserved for him
was wont to be a small and thin one, and consequently
specially brisk and active compared with the pigs that went
to market. More obvious similes are: as peart as a lop
[flea]; as peart as a pyet [magpie]; as peart as a cock-robin;
and with a figurative touch: as peart as a spoon.
Closely connected with the literary <em>uncouth</em>, is the widespread
dialect adjective <em>unkid</em>. It looks at first sight like the poor
relation from the country, clad in rough rustic garb, but
as a matter of fact it is historically a perfectly correct form,
<abbr title="compare">cp.</abbr> <abbr title="Middle English">M.E.</abbr> <em><span lang="enm" xml:lang="enm">unkid</span></em>, not made known, <em>-kid</em> = <abbr title="Old English">O.E.</abbr> <em><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">cȳðed</span></em>, <abbr title="past participle">p.p.</abbr> of
<em><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">cȳðan</span></em>, to make known. Indeed our <em>uncouth</em> is less regularly
developed in pronunciation. <em>Unkid</em> may be found in all
the dialects in England and Ireland, meaning: (1) strange,
unusual; (2) untidy, e.g. The missis took a dill a paayns uv
our Becca, but ’er couldna larn ’er to be tidy. ’Er sims
reg’lar unkid, ’er do (<abbr title="Worcestershire">Wor.</abbr>); (3) uncanny, horrid; (4) lonely,
depressed; (5) cross, sulky; (6) stormy; (7) of the weather:
close, sultry. Some of the terms for describing persons of
sullen, ill-tempered, or peevish dispositions are worth quoting:
e.g. cappernishious, crumpsy, frabby, glumpy—If he’s
glumpy, let him glump—muggaty, perjinkety, snippety. To
address a cantankerous person engaged in a quarrelsome
discussion as ‘You nasty brabagious creature’ must give
the speaker a pleasant sense of having said the right thing
at the right moment.</p>

the old family nurse, or the gardener who reigned supreme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
in the garden of long ago, and so for old sake’s sake these
words express more than meets the ear of a stranger. Here,
however, is a sample of verbs of various kinds: <em>brevit</em> (<abbr title="general">gen.</abbr>
use in <abbr title="Midlands">Midl.</abbr> counties), to search, ransack, <abbr class="silent" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, as in the
following account of a visit to the dentist: Soo the doctor,
a lukes at my tooth a bit, an’ begins a-brevetin’ abaout
among his bench o’ tules, an’ a says, tell ye what Joo, a says,
yo’ mut grin an’ aboide this turn. Soo ah says, ah cain’t
grin if ye doon’t lave me noo tooshes, ah says. Soo a says,
Ah, but yo’ can Joo, a says, yo’ can grin o’ the wrong soide;
<em>cabobble</em> (<abbr title="East Anglia">e.An.</abbr> <abbr title="Cornwall">Cor.</abbr>), to mystify, puzzle, confuse, e.g. You
wholly cabobble me; <em>chunner</em> (<abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr> <abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr> <abbr title="Lancashire">Lan.</abbr> <abbr title="Cheshire">Chs.</abbr> <abbr title="Derbyshire">Der.</abbr> <abbr title="Warwickshire">War.</abbr>
<abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr>), to grumble, mutter, murmur. A clergyman, asking
an infirm old woman how she was, received as an answer:
I goes on chunner, chunner, chunner. Whereupon he proceeded
to give her a homily showing how wrong it was to be
discontented, when he was stopped by the old woman:
Bless you, Parson, it’s not me that chunners, it’s my innards!
<em>Fratch</em> (<abbr title="north counties">n.counties</abbr>), to quarrel, dispute, as for example,
when a loud noise of wrangling voices is heard, some one may
suggest that it is two women fratching, or forty men
fighting; <em>glox</em> (<abbr title="Hampshire">Hmp.</abbr> <abbr title="Wiltshire">Wil.</abbr>), of liquids: to roll about, make
a gurgling sound when shaken inside a vessel; <em>goggaz</em> (<abbr title="Cheshire">Chs.</abbr>),
to stare, e.g. What a’t tha goggazin’ at naï? Tha’s noo moor
manners abaït thee till if tha’d bin born in a wood; <em>guggle</em>
(various dialects), to gurgle, make a bubbling sound, which
looks at first sight like a made-up word, but which was known
to Cotgrave, and to Dr. Johnson, who has: ‘To <em>Guggle</em>. <abbr title="verb neuter">v.n.</abbr>
[<em><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">gorgoliare</span></em>, Italian] To sound as water running with intermissions

money could not be accounted for, appeared this item:
‘To moffled away <abbr title="40 pounds">£40</abbr>.’ <em>Maunder</em> (<abbr title="general dialect">gen. dial.</abbr>), to talk idly
and incoherently, to mumble; <em>mopple</em> (<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr>), to confuse,

called, ‘engaged’ in prayer, when he became annoyed by
one of those present, who continually broke in with ejaculations
such as: Glory! Amen! Yus! <abbr class="silent" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> Suddenly the

said: Drop it, mun, tha mopples me. <em>Moither</em> (<abbr title="general dialect">gen. dial.</abbr>),
to confuse, perplex, bewilder, e.g. A wur that moithered,

C. Lamb’s letter to Coleridge, <abbr title="October">Oct.</abbr>&nbsp;17, 1796. <em>Nivel</em> (<abbr title="Gloucestershire">Glo.</abbr>

the classical illustration of the use of this word comes in the
story of Noah and the ancestor of the Lancashire folk.
This gentleman was swimming about in the Flood, and
meeting the Ark, he called out to Noah to take him aboard,
which the latter declined to do, on the grounds of lack of
space, adding by way of apology: We’re thrutched up wi’

All of a Goggle

<p class="new_para">A good descriptive word, which might well be adopted into
the standard speech, is <em>fantigue</em> (<abbr title="general dialect">gen. dial.</abbr>). To be in <em>a fine
fantigue</em> is to be in a state of fussy excitement, or a fit of ill
temper, usually without sufficient cause. Similarly, to be
<em>all in a confloption</em> (<abbr title="East Anglia">e.An.</abbr> <abbr title="Cornwall">Cor.</abbr>) well conveys the idea of
flurry, confusion; to be <em>all in a scrow</em> (<abbr title="north Country">n.Cy.</abbr>) is specially
used of that annually recurrent state of domestic disorder
known as spring-cleaning; to be <em>all of a goggle</em> (<abbr title="Gloucestershire">Glo.</abbr> <abbr title="Hampshire">Hmp.</abbr>
<abbr title="Isle of Wight">I.W.</abbr> <abbr title="Wiltshire">Wil.</abbr>) is to be trembling and shaking all over; to be
<em>all of a jother</em> (<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr>) is a parallel phrase. A stout old woman
describing her first experience of a railway journey, said:
Ah’ll niver gan in yan o’ thae nasty vans nae mair. Ah
trimmel’d and dither’d while [until] ah wur all iv a jother.
<em>All of a quob</em> (<abbr title="Wiltshire">Wil.</abbr> <abbr title="Cornwall">Cor.</abbr>) means in a heap. A Cornish woman
describing the way railway porters take luggage out of
a train said: They pitch it down all of a quob. A preacher
in a Lincolnshire chapel gave out as his text, ‘Behold, the
bridegroom cometh.’ Just then a newly married couple

the orator, that he exclaimed: Mi brethren, I’m clean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
blutterbunged. To be <em>in a wassle</em> (<abbr title="Gloucestershire">Glo.</abbr>) is to find oneself
in a muddle, or fix, as the preacher said when he got lost in
his discourse: My friends, you must excuse me, and sing
a hymn, for I am in a regular wassle. To be gone <em>all to
skubmaw</em> is to be in a state of wreckage, broken in pieces.
A Cornish minister is reported to have prayed: Lord!

Homespun Compounds
</div>

<p class="new_para">In the days of King Alfred, and of Ælfric, the Abbot of
Eynsham, literary English possessed numbers of good,
home-grown, compound words, which have since been lost,
and replaced by some more learned or diffuse substitute.
People said then: <em>book-craft</em> for literature; <em>star-craft</em> for
astronomy; <em>father-slayer</em> for parricide; <em>deed-beginner</em> for
perpetrator of crime; <em>together-speech</em> for colloquy; <em>old-speech</em>
for tradition; <em>well-willing</em> for benevolent, <abbr title="Old English">O.E.</abbr>
<em><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">bōc-cræft</span></em>, <em><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">tungol-cræft</span></em>, <em><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">fæder-slaga</span></em>, <em><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">dǣd-fruma</span></em>, <em><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">samod-sprǣc</span></em>,
<em><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">eald-sprǣc</span></em>, <em><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">welt-willende</span></em>. Sometimes again we have replaced
the old compound by a more concise but less picturesque
synonym. For <em>lore-house</em> we say school; for <em>dim-house</em>,
prison; for <em>again-coming</em>, return, <abbr title="Old English">O.E.</abbr> <em><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">lār-hūs</span></em>, <em><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">dim-hūs</span></em>,
<em><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">eft-cyme</span></em>. In the spoken dialects we have the natural development
of a living tongue, practically untouched by what are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
called the learned influences; hence, where in the literary
language we should use a word of Latin origin, we frequently
find a homespun compound used by dialect-speakers. We
shall see in a later chapter to what a large extent these compounds
are figurative and metaphorical; the few here quoted
belong only to the simplest type: <em>beet-need</em> (<abbr title="north Country">n.Cy.</abbr> <abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr> <abbr title="Lancashire">Lan.</abbr>),
a person or thing that helps in an emergency, <abbr title="compare">cp.</abbr> <abbr title="Old English">O.E.</abbr> <em><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">bētan</span></em>,
to improve; <em>cap-river</em>, a termagant; <em>cover-slut</em> (<abbr title="Leicestershire">Lei.</abbr> <abbr title="Northamptonshire">Nhp.</abbr>
<abbr title="Warwickshire">War.</abbr> <abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr>), a long apron used to hide an untidy dress;

animal, or thing, formerly serviceable but now past its prime,
as the old Lincolnshire man said: It stan’s to reason at yung
college-gentlemen like you knaws a vast sight moore then
a worn-oot hes-been like me, bud you weänt better God

<em>he-said</em>, or <em>he-say</em> (<abbr title="Westmorland">Wm.</abbr> <abbr title="west Yorkshire">w.Yks.</abbr>), a rumour; <em>never-sweat</em>
(<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr> <abbr title="Radnorshire">Rdn.</abbr> <abbr title="Oxfordshire">Oxf.</abbr>), an idle lazy fellow; <em>rip-stitch</em> (<abbr title="Lakeland">Lakel.</abbr> <abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr>
<abbr title="Lancashire">Lan.</abbr>), a romping boisterous child, e.g. What a rip-stitch that
lad is! If aw send him out i’ th’mornin’ wi’ his things o’

the justices how they ’adn never a-zeed wan t’other avore,
but lor! anybody could zee they was rogues-agreed; <em>good-doing</em>
(<abbr title="East Anglia">e.An.</abbr>), charitable; <em>penny-tight</em> (<abbr title="Lincolnshire">Lin.</abbr>), short of money;
<em>uptake</em> (<abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr> <abbr title="north Country">n.Cy.</abbr> <abbr title="Northumberland">Nhb.</abbr> <abbr title="Cumberland">Cum.</abbr>), intelligence, comprehension,
generally in the phrase <em>in</em> or <em>at the uptake</em>, e.g. He’s gleg i’ the
uptak [quick in understanding].</p>

<div class="sidenote">
Some fine shades of Meaning
</div>

<p class="new_para">Fine shades of meaning are often expressed in the dialects
by some slight variation in pronunciation which to our ears
might sound purely arbitrary or accidental, and also by the
distinctive use of one or other of two words which from
a dictionary point of view are synonymous. For example,
<em>drodge</em> and <em>drudge</em> both mean a person who works hard, but
the difference is this: a <em>drudge</em> is always kept working by
a superior, a <em>drodge</em> is always working because she cannot get
forward with her work; the word <em>drodge</em> implies blame, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
<em>drudge</em> none. <em>Geeble</em> (<em>g</em> soft), <em>gibble</em> (<em>g</em> soft), <em>jabble</em> (<abbr title="Banffshire">Bnff.</abbr>),
signify a quantity of liquid. The word <em>geeble</em> contains the
notion of contempt and dissatisfaction. When there is a
small quantity and greater contempt and dissatisfaction
indicated, <em>gibble</em> is used, and when a larger quantity, <em>jabble</em>
is used. <em>Muxy</em> and <em>puxy</em> (<abbr title="Somerset">Som.</abbr>) mean miry, but a <em>muxy</em>
lane would be merely a muddy lane, whereas a <em>puxy</em> lane
would be at least ankle-deep in mud; <em>steal</em> and <em>slance</em> (<abbr title="Lancashire">Lan.</abbr>
<abbr title="Cheshire">Chs.</abbr>) mean thieve. A boy may take a piece of pie from his
mother’s larder, and he will have <em>slanst</em> it, but if he did the
same thing from his neighbour’s place he would have <em>stolen</em>
it. Words like this would never be confused by people
accustomed to use them in everyday life.</p>

Difficulties of the Vernacular
</div>

<p class="new_para">Our difficulty in understanding the vernacular of a dialect-speaker
arises in great measure from the fact that many of
the sounds being unfamiliar to us, we cannot tell which
syllable belongs to which word, and so we cannot rightly
divide up the sentence into its component parts. This
would of course be much more easily done if we could at
once write down on paper what we have heard, and then
stake it off in sections, like the cryptic word which the
Kentish woman wrote to the village schoolmaster, to explain
the absence of her boy from school: keptatometugoataturin,
which became quite clear when divided up thus: kept-at-ome-tu-go-a-taturin,
that is, kept at home to go a-harvesting-potatoes.
For instance, what sounds like <em>oogerum</em> (<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr>)
stands for a whole sentence: <em>hug her them</em>, that is, carry
them for her. The sentence always quoted as the classic
puzzle of this type is: <em>ezonionye-onionye</em>, which being
interpreted means: have any of you any on you? Another
catch specimen of Yorkshire dialect is <em>t’weet maks’m pike’m</em>,
the wet makes them pick themselves, used of fowls cleaning
themselves after rain. Then further, many of the commonest
words have by the unhindered action of the laws
of living speech become so worn down, that we hardly
recognize them in this their dialect form, though we are
using them every day ourselves in the standard language.
Take for example such a sentence as: I shall have it in the
morning, which has been pared down to: as-et-it-morn (<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr>).
Our forefathers a thousand years ago would have said: <em><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Ic
sceal hit habban on ðǣm morgne</span></em>, every single word of which
remains firm and intelligible in its skeleton shape of: as [I
shall]-et [have it]-it [in the]-morn. Add to this an enormous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
vocabulary of words non-existent in literary English,
it is no wonder if sometimes the accents of a country rustic
sound in our ears like an unknown tongue. A story is told
of a Yorkshireman who went into a store of general wares in
London and asked: What diz ta keep here? <abbr title="Answer">Ans.</abbr> Oh,
everything. Yorkshireman: Ah deean’t think thoo diz. Hesta
onny coo-tah nobs [pieces of wood that secure the tie
for the legs of cows when being milked]?—a question which
reduced the cockney salesman to a state of helpless amazement.</p>

Sometimes a request for an interpretation of mysterious
words only draws forth more of the same nature, for instance:
Mester, that back kitchen’s welly snying [swarming]
wi’ twitch-clogs. What do you mean by twitch-clogs, Mary?
Whoi, black-jacks (<abbr title="Cheshire">Chs.</abbr>). But ‘Mester’ was still in blissful
ignorance of the presence of black-beetles in his back kitchen.
The following conversation is reported from Somersetshire:
I wish you would tell me where you get your rennet. Why,
I buys a vell and zalts’n in. A vell! whatever is that?
Don’ee know hot a vell is? Why a pook, be sure! Dear me,

say? Clerk (slowly and decisively): She says the defendant
clooted her heead, rove her cap, lugged her hair, dhragged

the inability to comprehend is on the side of the country
rustic. At a school in Wensleydale a South-country inspector,
examining a class on the Bible, said: Neow tell me
something abeout Mouses. Cats kill ’em, was the prompt
rejoinder. A lady reading <cite>Exodus</cite> <abbr title="chapter 9 verse 3">ix. 3</abbr>, ‘<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">There shall be
a very grievous murrain</span>,’ to a Sunday School class of Cornish
children, was puzzled by the seemingly irrelevant comment
made by one of her scholars: Ants is awful things, aint ’em?
Afterwards she discovered that an ant in Cornwall is called
a <em>muryan</em>. A similar story comes from Sussex. A lady
who had been giving a lesson on Pharaoh’s dreams was
startled to find that all the boys supposed that the <span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">fat</span> and
<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">lean kine</span> were weasels. In Surrey, Kent, and Sussex a
weasel is called a <em>kine</em>, or <em>keen</em>. An old labourer reading
the <cite>Book of Genesis</cite> came to this verse: ‘<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">And Israel said,
It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go and see
him before I die</span>’ (<abbr title="chapter 45 verse 28">chap. xlv. 28</abbr>). There’s a hatch zomewhere

<p class="new_para">The quaintly-worded command, Ye mun begin an’ aikle nai
(<abbr title="Cheshire">Chs.</abbr>), has more significance than meets the eye of those who
read it now, for it records a faint echo from the times of that
ancient institution once common to every village, but now
obsolete, namely, the Dame’s School, the theme of Shenstone’s
poem, <cite>The School-Mistress</cite> (1742), wherein he sought
to imitate the ‘peculiar tenderness of sentiment remarkable
throughout’ the works of Spenser:</p>

An old Village Dame
</div>

<p>Shenstone’s old dame kept a ‘birchen tree’ from which she
cut her ‘scepter’; he does not mention the other weapon
of torture wielded by these female tyrants, which was the
thimble. The poor children were rapped on the head with
a thimbled finger, and the operation was known as <em>thimble-pie</em>
making. The old dame that I remember, who must have
been one of the last of all her race, was of milder mood than
these. Her name was Mrs. Price, and she dwelt in a remote
and picturesque corner of Herefordshire called Tedstone
Delamere. I cannot call it a village, or even a hamlet, for
the houses were so very few and far between. Mrs. Price’s
scholars were mere baby creatures, old enough to run about
and get into mischief, or court danger, and yet too young
to be sent to the parish school with their bigger brothers and
sisters. So busy mothers were glad to pay a trifling sum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
to have these little ones tended by a motherly old widow-woman
for a few hours every morning. But the time came
when age and infirmity debarred her from even this light task,
and her cottage no longer resounded with those noises which
‘Do learning’s little tenement betray’. I found her one
day sitting all alone with an open Bible on the table beside
her, and her spectacles lying idle in her lap. She looked tired
and dispirited, and said her eyes were so bad that she had
been obliged to stop reading, and sit doing nothing. Naturally
I offered to read aloud to her awhile, and I inquired what
had been engaging her attention. ‘Oh,’ said she, ‘I’d just
got to where the frogs came up upon Pharaoh.’ I took the
book, and read on and on, for each time I came to ‘the
Lord hardened Pharaoh’s heart’, the aged Mrs. Price evinced
such satisfaction over the prospect of yet another Plague, that
I had not the heart to cut a long story short. At last when
Pharaoh had finally bidden the Israelites ‘be gone’, I closed the
Bible, and as I did so, the old lady exclaimed, ‘Ain’t that nice
readin’!’ One would not have thought that the history of the
seven Plagues of Egypt was exactly the portion of Scripture
best fitted to cheer and comfort a lone and feeble old woman.
Perhaps it stirred old fires in her blood, rekindling memories
of the days when children deemed her ‘the greatest wight
on ground’, when she held the reins of power, distributing
rewards and punishments as the honoured head of a Dame’s
School.</p>

<span class="sub_head">CORRUPTIONS AND POPULAR ETYMOLOGIES</span></h2>

<p class="new_para">If we are to avoid on the one hand the danger of regarding
a dialect as nothing better than a wilful perversion of
standard English, we yet must not allow ourselves to be
beguiled by the smooth-running course of true sound-laws, or
the rural charm of quaint words, into the opposite error of
supposing that irregularities and distortions do not exist.
There are in the dialects numbers of words which can only be
regarded as corruptions and mispronunciations of literary
English, but considered relatively to the whole vocabulary
the proportion of them is very small. Many even of the
most obvious are not without a certain interest as examples
of popular etymology, or of practical word-formation, as, for
instance, when smother and suffocate are blended into the
useful word <em>smothercate</em> (<abbr title="Nottinghamshire">Not.</abbr>), or bold and audacious into
<em>boldacious</em> (<abbr title="Derbyshire">Der.</abbr> <abbr title="Cornwall">Cor.</abbr>). Some apparent corruptions are in
reality old forms which can be found in the literary language
in the earlier stages of its existence. For example: <em>abuseful</em>
(<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr> <abbr title="Lincolnshire">Lin.</abbr> <abbr title="Warwickshire">War.</abbr> <abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr> <abbr title="Herefordshire">Hrf.</abbr> <abbr title="Gloucestershire">Glo.</abbr>) for abusive is not uncommon
in seventeenth-century literature, though it must have died
out later, as it is not noted by lexicographers such as Bailey
and Johnson. The word <em>fancical</em> (<abbr title="general dialect">gen. dial.</abbr>) for fanciful
occurs in 1676 in a work entitled <cite>Musick’s Monument</cite>, by
Mace. <em>Druggister</em> (<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr> <abbr title="Lincolnshire">Lin.</abbr> <abbr title="Pembrokeshire">Pem.</abbr> <abbr title="East Anglia">e.An.</abbr> <abbr title="Somerset">Som.</abbr> <abbr title="Cornwall">Cor.</abbr>) for druggist
is registered in Sherwood’s <cite>Dictionary</cite> (1672), ‘A
<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">druggister</span>, <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">drogueur</span></em>.’</p>

<p class="new_para">Or again, the dialect form may not be directly taken from
the standard language, but may be traced back through
some other linguistic channel which has influenced its
development, e.g. <em>angish</em> (<abbr title="Ireland">Irel.</abbr>) is not a mispronunciation of
anguish, but it is developed from the Gaelic form <em><span lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">aingis</span></em>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
<em>Squinacy</em> (<abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr> <abbr title="Ireland">Irel.</abbr>), and <em>squinancy</em> in the compound <em>squinancy-berry</em>
(<abbr title="Cumberland">Cum.</abbr> <abbr title="Lancashire">Lan.</abbr> <abbr title="Essex">Ess.</abbr>), the black currant, are not
corruptions of quinsy, but are from <abbr title="Old French">O.French</abbr> <em><span lang="fro" xml:lang="fro">squinancie</span></em>,
quinsy. But I shall reserve the treatment of historical
forms such as these for a later chapter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
Latin Phrases taken into the Dialects
</div>

<p class="new_para">A few Latin phrases have made their way into the dialects,
where they have assumed curious forms and meanings.
For example: <em>hizy-prizy</em> (<abbr title="Northumberland">Nhb.</abbr> <abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr> <abbr title="Cheshire">Chs.</abbr> <abbr title="Derbyshire">Der.</abbr> <abbr title="Somerset">Som.</abbr> <abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr>),
a corruption of <em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nisi prius</span></em>, a law-term. It is used to signify
any kind of chicanery or sharp practice, or, used as an
adjective, it means litigious, tricky; and in the phrase <em>to
be at hizy-prizy</em>, it means to be quarrelsome, disagreeable.
The plural form <em>momenty-morries</em> (<abbr title="Northumberland">Nhb.</abbr>), skeletons, stands
for <em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">memento mori</span></em>, remember that thou must die, the name
given to a small decorative object containing a skeleton or
other emblem of death, <abbr title="compare">cp.</abbr> ‘<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">I make as good use of it as
many a man doth of a Death’s-head or a memento mori</span>,’
<cite><abbr title="Henry the Forth Part 1">1 Hen. IV</abbr></cite>, <abbr title="Act 3 scene 3 line 35"><span class="act">III</span>. iii. 35</abbr>. The Latin <em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nolens volens</span></em> appears as
<em>nolus-bolus</em> (<abbr title="Wiltshire">Wil.</abbr>), <em>nolum-wolum</em> (<abbr title="Wiltshire">Wil.</abbr> <abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr>), <em>hoylens-voylens</em>,
<em>oilins-boilins</em> (<abbr title="Cumberland">Cum.</abbr>). A mother sending off an unwilling
child to school will say: Oilins-boilins, but thee shall go.
<em>Nominy</em> (<abbr title="Northumberland">Nhb.</abbr> <abbr title="Durham">Dur.</abbr> <abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr> <abbr title="Lancashire">Lan.</abbr> <abbr title="Cheshire">Chs.</abbr> <abbr title="Derbyshire">Der.</abbr> <abbr title="Northamptonshire">Nhp.</abbr>) represents the

used by the preacher before the sermon. It means:
(1) a rigmarole, a long rambling tale, a wordy, tiresome
speech; (2) a rhyming formula or folk-rhyme. A knitting
nominy used by girls in Northamptonshire is as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="p_line">I’ll rap your knuckles with my knitting-pin.</div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p class="cont"><em>Paddy-noddy</em>, or <em>Parinody</em> (<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr> <abbr title="Lincolnshire">Lin.</abbr>), a long tedious rigmarole,
a cock and bull story, is a corruption of <em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pater noster</span></em>. The
form <em>non-plush</em> (many <abbr title="dialects">dials.</abbr>), a nonplus, dilemma, surprise,
usually occurs in the phrase: <em>at</em>, or <em>on a non-plush</em>, e.g. I was
taken all on a non-plutch. <em>Vady</em> (<abbr title="Sussex">Sus.</abbr> <abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr>) is a shortened
form of <em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vade mecum</span></em>, used to denote a small leather cylinder,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
containing change of raiment, and other small comforts of
the traveller.</p>

<p class="new_para">The French <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rendezvous</span></em> appears as <em>randivoo</em>, <em>randivoose</em>
(<abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr> <abbr title="Cornwall">Cor.</abbr>), <em>randybow</em> (<abbr title="Northumberland">Nhb.</abbr> <abbr title="Cheshire">Chs.</abbr> <abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr>), <em>rangevouge</em> (<abbr title="Cornwall">Cor.</abbr>),
meaning a noise, an uproar, but the literary sense remains
in the verb <em>rumsey-voosey</em> (<abbr title="Wiltshire">Wil.</abbr>), e.g. He went a rumsey-voosing
down the lane to meet his sweetheart.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
Corruptions and Mispronunciations
</div>

<p class="new_para"><em>Jommetry</em> is interesting for the sake of its meaning. It is
used in Gloucestershire in the sense of magic; anything supported
in a mysterious and unknown manner might be said
to hang <em>by jommetry</em>; the phrase <em>all of a jommetry</em> means in
pieces or tatters. <em>Lattiprack</em> (<abbr title="Wiltshire">Wil.</abbr>) for paralytic is a strange
distortion. <em>Hapsherrapsher</em> (<abbr title="Cumberland">Cum.</abbr> <abbr title="Lakeland">Lakel.</abbr>) for haphazard is
equally unreasonable, but agreeable withal. Forms like
<em>solintary</em> (<abbr title="Norfolk">Nrf.</abbr>) for solitary, <em>skelington</em> or <em>skelinton</em> (<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr> <abbr title="Lancashire">Lan.</abbr>

<em>pumptial</em> (<abbr title="Nottinghamshire">Not.</abbr> <abbr title="Rutland">Rut.</abbr> <abbr title="Leicestershire">Lei.</abbr> <abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr> <abbr title="Somerset">Som.</abbr>) for punctual; <em>turmit</em> or
<em>turmut</em> (<abbr title="general dialect">gen. dial.</abbr>) for turnip, can all be accounted for
phonetically. <em>Hantle</em> (<abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr> <abbr title="Ireland">Irel.</abbr> and <abbr title="north">n.</abbr> counties to <abbr title="Warwickshire">War.</abbr> <abbr title="Worcestershire">Wor.</abbr>
<abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr>) is a perfectly legitimate contraction of handful, but
besides the ordinary meaning, it can also denote a large
quantity. A story is told of a Scotch minister who alluded
in his sermon to the fact that a number of his flock had joined
the Baptists, thus: I thocht till ha’e gethered ye under my
wings, as a hen gethereth her chickens, but a hantle o’ ye ha’e
turn’t oot to be deuks, an’ ta’en to the water.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
A ‘nice Derangement of Epitaphs’
</div>

<p class="new_para">Occasionally one literary word is mistaken for another,
and adopted in its place, as, for instance, <em>information</em> (<abbr title="Lincolnshire">Lin.</abbr>
<abbr title="Sussex">Sus.</abbr> <abbr title="Somerset">Som.</abbr> <abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr>) used for inflammation; <em>sentiment</em> (<abbr title="Lincolnshire">Lin.</abbr>
<abbr title="Norfolk">Nrf.</abbr>) for sediment. A farmer having been asked if he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
clean out a pond, replied: No, sir, I can’t undertake the job;
there’s a sight of sentiment in that there pit.
<em>Profligate</em>
(<abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr> <abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr>) for prolific is a surprising change of adjective,
especially when applied to the guileless and innocent.
I remember my old nurse, when she took to minding chickens
because we had outgrown the need of her daily ministrations,
telling me that she had collected a ‘sitting’ of a certain kind
of eggs, because she thought it would produce ‘a profligate
hatch’. This is paralleled by the use of <em>reprobate</em> for probationer.
The Vicar’s daughter asked a young girl if she
had joined the parochial Guild. The reply was: Oh, yes,
Miss! Last week I were took in as a reprobate (<abbr title="Lincolnshire">Lin.</abbr>). A youth
writing home from Canada to his father the village blacksmith,
in describing the Coronation festivities in the city
where he dwelt, wrote: The soldiers fired three volumes.
A rheumatic old woman, who had been taken with several
others for an excursion on a very hot day, said to me: Have
you heard what a very nice exertion we had yesterday?
Quite recently too, I was told of a man who had been
‘crossed in love’ in his youth, that he had been a woman-atheist
ever since. One is constantly reminded of Mrs.
Malaprop and her ‘nice derangement of epitaphs’. <em>Unction</em>
(<abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr>) for auction, with its derivative unctioneer, is probably a
phonetic change; and the same may be said of <em>ivory</em> (<abbr title="Ireland">Irel.</abbr>
<abbr title="Nottinghamshire">Not.</abbr> <abbr title="Lincolnshire">Lin.</abbr> <abbr title="Rutland">Rut.</abbr> <abbr title="Hertfordshire">Hrt.</abbr> <abbr title="East Anglia">e.An.</abbr>) for ivy. The use of <em>persecute</em> for
prosecute may be merely the result of confusion of prefixes,
as in: discommode, dismolish, mislest, perdigious, preverse.
The use of the native prefix <em>un-</em> where the standard language
has <em>im-</em>, <em>in-</em>, <abbr class="silent" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, is very frequent. For instance, <em>unpossible</em>
occurs in all the dialects in Scotland, Ireland, and England.
Other examples are: undecent (many <abbr title="dialects">dials.</abbr>), unlegal (<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr>
<abbr title="Midlands">Midl.</abbr> <abbr title="Warwickshire">War.</abbr> <abbr title="Herefordshire">Hrf.</abbr>), unregular (many <abbr title="dialects">dials.</abbr>), unsensible (<abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr>
<abbr title="Durham">Dur.</abbr> <abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr> <abbr title="Warwickshire">War.</abbr> <abbr title="Surrey">Sur.</abbr>), unpatient (<abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr> <abbr title="Durham">Dur.</abbr> <abbr title="Lancashire">Lan.</abbr>), unpeaceable
(<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr> <abbr title="Somerset">Som.</abbr>), unperfect (<abbr title="north Country">n.Cy.</abbr> <abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr> <abbr title="Lancashire">Lan.</abbr> <abbr title="Somerset">Som.</abbr>), unpassable
(<abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr> <abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr> <abbr title="Somerset">Som.</abbr>). The three last were once good literary
forms, and may be found with quotations from learned
authors in Johnson’s <cite>Dictionary</cite>. Beside <em>unconvenient</em> there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
exists in many dialects the useful compound <em>ill-convenient</em>.
<em>Unhonest</em> for dishonest, though now a dialect form, occurs
in literature of the sixteenth century.</p>

death’, rises almost into poetic simplicity. In the hybrid form
<em>unheeastie</em> (<abbr title="north Yorkshire">n.Yks.</abbr>), indolent, we have an old word which

Corruptions due to popular Etymology
</div>

<p class="new_para">Closely akin to these are the corruptions due to what is
called popular etymology, where an unfamiliar word or
syllable becomes converted into a familiar one. Occasionally
it is possible to trace some association of meaning to account
for the change in pronunciation, as when week-days becomes
<em>wicked-days</em> (<abbr title="west Country">w.Cy.</abbr> <abbr title="Somerset">Som.</abbr>), probably with an idea of contra-distinction
to Sundays and Holy Days. <em>Illify</em> (<abbr title="Lakeland">Lakel.</abbr> <abbr title="Cumberland">Cum.</abbr>
<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr> <abbr title="Lancashire">Lan.</abbr> <abbr title="Staffordshire">Stf.</abbr> <abbr title="Lincolnshire">Lin.</abbr>) for vilify explains itself. The common
example given to illustrate this change is the standard
English word belfry. Dr. Johnson states the case thus:
‘<em>Belfry.</em> <abbr title="noun substantive">n.s.</abbr> [<em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Beffroy</span></em>, in French, is a tower; which was
perhaps the true word, till those, who knew not its original,
corrupted it to <em>belfry</em>, because bells were in it].’ One is
tempted to suggest that <em>madancholy</em> (<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr> <abbr title="Lancashire">Lan.</abbr>) for melancholy
started life as a descriptive term for victims of melancholia,
but unfortunately there is the fact that just in those
districts where the word occurs, <em>mad</em> does not mean insane,
but annoyed, angry, and the suggestion is shown to be absurd. <em>Madancholy</em> must therefore rank with the great majority
of corruptions due to sound-change, typified by the hackneyed
form <em>sparrow-grass</em> for asparagus. Jerusalem artichoke
for <em>girasole</em> artichoke is recognized as standard English,
so also is gooseberry. Dr. Johnson has: ‘<em>Gooseberry.</em> <abbr title="noun substantive">n.s.</abbr>
[<em>goose</em> and <em>berry</em>, because eaten with young geese as sauce].’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
Modern philologists, however, scorn this simple solution, and
referring us to a French original, they say gooseberry is
a corruption of *groise-berry, or *grose-berry. In Marshall’s
<cite>Rural Economy of Yorkshire</cite> (1796) we find the form grossberry,
and this gross- is the same as the element gros- in
French <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">groseille</span></em>, a gooseberry. The Scotch form is <em>groset</em>.
The pronunciation <em>cowcumber</em> (<abbr title="general dialect">gen. dial.</abbr> use in <abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr> <abbr title="Ireland">Irel.</abbr> <abbr title="England">Eng.</abbr>)
for cucumber was early recognized as corrupt. A paragraph
in a book called <cite><span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">The English Physitian Enlarged</span></cite> (seventeenth
century) is entitled: ‘<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Cucumers, or (according to the
pronuntiation of the Vulgar) cowcumbers.</span>’ Other examples
from various dialects are: <em>ash-falt</em> for asphalt; <em>brown-kitus</em>,
<em>brown-titus</em>, <em>brown-typhus</em> for bronchitis; <em>chiny oysters</em> (<abbr title="Wiltshire">Wil.</abbr>)
for China asters; <em>Polly Andrews</em> (<abbr title="Gloucestershire">Glo.</abbr> <abbr title="Wiltshire">Wil.</abbr>) for polyanthus;
<em>rosydendrum</em> (<abbr title="Cheshire">Chs.</abbr>) for rhododendron; <em>curly-flower</em> (<abbr title="Lincolnshire">Lin.</abbr>)
for cauliflower; <em>fair-maid</em> (<abbr title="Cornwall">Cor.</abbr>) for fumade, fumadoe, a
cured (formerly smoked) pilchard, <abbr title="Spanish">Sp.</abbr> <em><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">fumado</span></em>, smoked;
<em>hairy-sipples</em> for erysipelas; the <em>janders</em> (many <abbr title="dialects">dials.</abbr>) for
jaundice; <em>a-kingbow</em>, <em>king-bow</em> (<abbr title="Somerset">Som.</abbr>), for akimbo; <em>pockmanteau</em>
(<abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr> <abbr title="Northumberland">Nhb.</abbr> <abbr title="Lincolnshire">Lin.</abbr>) for portmanteau, but the substitution
of <em>pock-</em> for port-is probably due to association of meaning
with <em>pock</em>, a bag, sack, or wallet; <em>airy-mouse</em>, <em>hairy-mouse</em>,
<em>raw-mouse</em> (<abbr title="Hampshire">Hmp.</abbr> <abbr title="Isle of Wight">I.W.</abbr> <abbr title="Wiltshire">Wil.</abbr>), <em>rye-mouse</em> (<abbr title="Gloucestershire">Glo.</abbr> <abbr title="Wiltshire">Wil.</abbr>), for rear-mouse,
the bat, <abbr title="Old English">O.E.</abbr> <em><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">hrēre-mūs</span></em>; <em>screwmatic</em> (<abbr title="Warwickshire">War.</abbr> <abbr title="Norfolk">Nrf.</abbr>)

tutenag, an alloy of copper, zinc, and nickel. Years ago—years
and years and donkey’s ears, as the saying is—when
motor-cars were yet unborn, and when even tram-cars were
unknown to country children, I can remember my father
trying to explain to the little carol-singers at Christmastime,

‘The rustic Etymologer
</div>

<p class="new_para">Now and then we meet with a deliberate attempt on the
part of dialect speakers themselves to explain the mysteries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
of word-derivation. The writer of a book entitled <cite>The Folk
and their Word-Lore</cite> tells of ‘the rustic etymologer’ who
explained that the reason why partridges are so called is
‘because ... they love to lie between the furrows of ploughed
land, and so <em>part</em> the <em>ridges</em>’. Further, he tells us that: ‘a
cottager lamenting that one of a litter of puppies had a hare-lip
(divided like that of the hare), or, as she pronounced it,
<em>air-lip</em>, explained that it was so called because it admitted
the air through the cleft, which prevented the little creature
sucking properly.’ But these are not the folk who are
responsible for the absurd popular etymology which associates
the modern colloquial and slang use of the word <em>lark</em> with
the <abbr title="Old English">O.E.</abbr> <em><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">lāc</span></em> <abbr title="substantive">sb.</abbr>, joyous activity, sport, <em><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">lācan</span></em> <abbr title="verb">vb.</abbr>, to play,

This error is the invention of non-philological people who
speak standard English. It could not have been propounded
by any one who uses the word <em>lake</em>, nor by any one who
understands English philology. <abbr title="Old English">O.E.</abbr> <em><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">lācan</span></em> would have
given in standard English, and in most of the above-mentioned
dialects, a form <em>loke</em>, and under no circumstances
could it have acquired the <em>r</em>. Apparently <em>to lark</em> is a verb
made from the substantive <em>lark</em>, the bird. <abbr title="Old English">O.E.</abbr> <em><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">lācan</span></em> has
died out, but its Scandinavian cognate <abbr title="Old Norse">O.N.</abbr> <em><span lang="non" xml:lang="non">leika</span></em>, to play,
sport, remains in the dialect form <em>lake</em>.</p>

<p class="new_para">For mere distortion and mispronunciation a good illustration
is the variety of dialect shapes which the word breakfast

<p class="new_para">The linguistic importance of the dialect-vocabulary for
the study of our English language and literature in its earlier
periods cannot be over-estimated, for herein is preserved
a wealth of historical words familiar to us in our older literature,
but lost to our standard speech. Numbers of words
used by Chaucer and the early Middle English poets, by
Shakespeare, and by the translators of the Bible, which are
now treated as archaisms to be explained in footnotes and
appendices to the text, still live and move and have their
being among our rural population to-day. Take for illustration

<p class="cont">The three principal words have disappeared from the literary
language, and to give an exact rendering of these two brief
sentences we should have to paraphrase them something
like this: The snow, full keenly cold, blew on the biting
blast, which pinched the deer with frost. But if we turn
to the dialects, there we find all three: <em>snitter</em> (<abbr title="Shetland Isles">Sh.I.</abbr> <abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr>),
to snow, <abbr title="substantive">sb.</abbr> a biting blast; <em>snar</em>, <em>snarry</em> (<abbr title="Cumberland">Cum.</abbr> <abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr>), cold,

between <em>snart</em> and <em>snar</em> is accounted for by the fact that it
is a Norse word. An adjective in Norse takes a <em>t</em> in the
neuter, and this <em>t</em> not being recognized on these shores as an
inflexional ending was sometimes adopted into English as if
it belonged to the stem of the word, as for example in the
literary words scant, want, athwart, <abbr title="compare">cp.</abbr> <abbr title="Icelandic">Icel.</abbr> <em><span lang="is" xml:lang="is">snarr</span></em>, swift,
keen, <abbr title="neuter">neut.</abbr> <em><span lang="is" xml:lang="is">snart</span></em>. Many a delightful old word which ran<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
away from a public career a century or two ago, and left no
address, may thus be discovered in its country retreat, hale
and hearty yet, though hoary with age. It is hard to make
a choice among so many, especially where the chosen must
be few, but the following may perhaps serve as representatives
of the remainder: <em>attercop</em> (<abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr> <abbr title="Ireland">Irel.</abbr> <abbr title="Northumberland">Nhb.</abbr> <abbr title="Cumberland">Cum.</abbr> <abbr title="Westmorland">Wm.</abbr>
<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr> <abbr title="Lancashire">Lan.</abbr> <abbr title="Cheshire">Chs.</abbr> <abbr title="Wiltshire">Wil.</abbr>), a spider. This was in Old English
<em><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">attorcoppe</span></em>, a spider, from <em><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">ātor</span></em>, <em><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">attor</span></em>, poison, and <em><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">coppe</span></em>,
which probably means head, the old idea being that spiders
were poisonous insects. In the <abbr title="Middle English">M.E.</abbr> poem <cite>The Owl and the

eating ‘<span lang="enm" xml:lang="enm">nothing but attercops, and foul flies, and worms</span>’.

people, this word has gained some footing in our colloquial
speech, and it has always had a place in poetical diction, but
its real stronghold is Scotland and the North. Perhaps no
other word breathes such a spirit of human love and tenderness
as this does. How infinitely superior is <em>the barns</em> to

From this was developed the standard English form <em>wont</em>,
which ought to be pronounced <em>wunt</em>, but the graphic <em>o</em> has
been taken for an original <em>o</em>, and the spelling has influenced
the pronunciation. <em>Wont</em> occurs in a few of the Midland
dialects as a verb meaning to familiarize, to domesticate,
accustom, e.g. If you tek the cat, you’ll hev to butter her

Shakesperian Words in the Dialects
</div>

<p class="new_para">In the same way most of the obsolete Shakespearian
words can still be traced in the dialects. The Shakespeare-Bacon
theory, if not too dead and gone to be worth further
combat, could easily be completely overthrown by any one
who chose to array against it the convincing mass of evidence
which proves Shakespeare’s intimate acquaintance with the
Warwickshire dialect. Numbers of the words and phrases
which Shakespeare used, and which we have since lost, still
exist in his native county, and in the other counties bordering
on Warwickshire. Some of them were at that date part
and parcel of the standard vocabulary, and might be put
by Shakespeare into the mouths of his highest personages;
others again must even then have been regarded by him as
dialect, and natural only to the speech of lower folk. It is
Corporal Nym who says <em><span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">shog</span></em> for move, jog: ‘<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Will you shog

Dr. Johnson’s Testimony
</div>

<p class="new_para">Dr. Johnson bears his testimony to Shakespeare’s knowledge
of dialect and colloquial speech in the Preface to the
Dictionary: ‘If the language of theology were extracted
from Hooker and the translation of the Bible; the terms
of natural knowledge from Bacon; the phrases of policy,
war, and navigation from Raleigh; the dialect of poetry
and fiction from Spenser and Sidney; and the diction of
common life from Shakespeare, few ideas would be lost to
mankind, for want of English words, in which they might
be expressed.’ But the Dictionary ‘was intended primarily
to furnish a standard of polite usage, suitable for the classic
ideals of the new age’ (<abbr title="vide">v.</abbr> <cite>Six Essays on Johnson</cite>, by Walter
Raleigh, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 82). Johnson, therefore, though he incorporated
this ‘diction of common life’, did not hesitate to sit in judgment
upon it when he thought fit. Take for example the
phrase <em>to make bold</em>, which appears in the <cite>Dictionary</cite> thus:
‘<em>to make bold</em>. To take freedoms: a phrase not grammatical,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
though common. <em>To be bold</em> is better; as, <em>I was bold to
speak</em>.</p>

Johnson’s Dictionary
</div>

<p class="cont">(This—it may be mentioned in passing—is one of the cases
where Johnson is quoting from memory, rather than from
a printed text, as is shown by slight verbal inaccuracies,
<abbr title="vide">v.</abbr> <cite><abbr title="Othello">Oth.</abbr></cite> <abbr title="Act 3 scene 1 line 35"><span class="act">III.</span> i. 35</abbr>.) Or again: ‘<em>To have rather</em>. [This is,
I think, a barbarous expression of late intrusion into our
language, for which it is better to say <em>will rather</em>.]’ It is
a very common phrase in Shakespeare, though Johnson does
not here cite his authority.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
Johnson’s Dialect
</div>

<p class="new_para">In the early days of Dictionaries a lexicographer impressed
his work with the stamp of his own personality in a way
which is impossible in modern times when Dictionary-making
ranks among the abstract sciences. Johnson’s Dictionary is
pre-eminently personal, betraying the author’s character and
opinions at every turn; indeed, certain definitions, such as
those of ‘lexicographer’, ‘grubstreet’, ‘pension’, ‘excise’,
<abbr class="silent" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, have become the hackneyed illustrations wherever
Johnson’s life and writings are discussed. It is not surprising,
therefore, if we find in his treatment of dialect words some
points of biographical interest. Certain of his views with
regard to literature and language are plainly given in his
Preface to the Dictionary: ‘I soon discovered that the bulk
of my volumes would fright away the student, and was
forced to depart from my scheme of including all that was
pleasing or useful in English literature, and reduce my
transcripts very often to clusters of words, in which scarcely
any meaning is retained; thus to the weariness of copying,
I was condemned to add the vexation of expunging. Some
passages I have yet spared, which may relieve the labour of
verbal searches, and intersperse with verdure and flowers
the dusty desarts of barren philology.’ Speaking of the
difficulty of collecting words, he says: ‘the deficiency of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
dictionaries was immediately apparent; and when they
were exhausted, what was yet wanting must be sought by
fortuitous and unguided excursions into books, and gleaned
as industry should find, or chance should offer it, in the
boundless chaos of living speech.... That many terms of art
and manufacture are omitted, must be frankly acknowledged;
but for this defect I may boldly allege that it was unavoidable:
I could not visit caverns to learn the miner’s language, nor take
a voyage to perfect my skill in the dialect of navigation, nor
visit the warehouses of merchants, and shops of artificers, to
gain the names of wares, tools, and operations, of which no
mention is found in books; what favourable accident, or easy
inquiry brought within my reach, has not been neglected;
but it had been a hopeless labour to glean up words, by
courting living information, and contesting with the sullenness
of one, and the roughness of another.’ But even a
cursory glance through the pages of the Dictionary show
that where the ‘living information’ was his own knowledge
of the dialect words of his native county it was a ‘labour’ of
love to glean them up and place them among his ‘verdure
and flowers’, above the region of ‘boundless chaos’. Just
as it can be shown from the internal evidence of their respective
Dictionaries that Skinner belonged to Lincolnshire, Levins
to Yorkshire, and Cotgrave to Cheshire, so it could be proved
that Johnson belonged to Staffordshire, even if we had no
other testimony outside his Dictionary. Some of the most
striking of these evidences are as follows: ‘Lich.... A dead
carcase; whence <em>lichwake</em>, the time or act of watching by the
dead; <em>lichgate</em>, the gate through which the dead are carried
to the grave; <em>Lichfield</em>, the field of the dead, a city in
Staffordshire, so named from martyred Christians. <em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Salve
magna parens</span>.</em>’ ‘<em>Kecksy</em>. <abbr title="noun substantive">n.s.</abbr> [commonly <em>kex</em>, <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cigue</span></em>,
French; <em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">cicuta</span></em>, Latin. Skinner.] Skinner seems to think
<em>kecksy</em> or <em>kex</em> the same as hemlock. It is used in Staffordshire
both for hemlock, and any other hollow jointed plant.’
‘Shaw.... A thicket; A small wood. A tuft of trees near
Lichfield is called Gentle <em>shaw</em>.’ ‘Tup. <abbr title="noun substantive">n.s.</abbr> [I know not of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
what original.] A ram. This word is yet used in Staffordshire,
and in other provinces.’ In other cases, though he
does not mention his own native county, he seems to be so
familiar with the word in question, as belonging to rustic
speech, that, with the evidence of its existence in the Midland
dialects of to-day, we may safely assume that it was current
in the Staffordshire dialect of his time. For example:
‘Huff. <abbr title="noun substantive">n.s.</abbr> [from <em>hove</em>, or <em>hoven</em>, swelled: he is <em>huffed up
by distempers</em>. So in some provinces we still say the bread
<em>huffs up</em>, when it begins to <em>heave</em> or ferment: <em>huff</em>, therefore,
may be ferment. To be in a <em>huff</em> is then to be in a <em>ferment</em>,
as we now speak],’ <abbr title="compare">cp.</abbr> <em>huff</em> (<abbr title="Shetland Isles">Sh.I.</abbr> <abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr> <abbr title="Leicestershire">Lei.</abbr> <abbr title="Northamptonshire">Nhp.</abbr> <abbr title="Warwickshire">War.</abbr>), to
swell, puff up; to rise in baking, generally used with <em>up</em>.

unlikely evils to befall them. Other examples of extant
Scottish words noted by Johnson are Ambry, Bannock,
Jannock, Lyart, Lope, Piggin, Sark, Skep, Thrapple, Throdden.
Numbers of modern dialect words are to be found in
Johnson’s Dictionary stigmatized by him as ‘low’. Without making a complete collection of them, and submitting
them to careful linguistic study, it is impossible to say
definitely in each case why he thus marked them off from
polite speech. One is, however, tempted to think that he
sometimes thus disposed of a word simply because he did
not happen to know it in his own dialect; for some of his
‘low’ words have no worse history than others which he
admits as ‘provincial’. For example: ‘To dag. <abbr title="verb active">v.a.</abbr>...
To daggle; to bemire; to let fall in the water,’ is given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
as ‘a low word’, while the synonymous ‘To daggle’ is admitted
without comment; <abbr title="compare">cp.</abbr> <em>dag</em>, to trail in the dew, wet,
or mire, to bedraggle, now essentially a Midland word, and
<em>daggle</em> (<abbr title="north Country">n.Cy.</abbr> <abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr> <abbr title="Cheshire">Chs.</abbr> <abbr title="Leicestershire">Lei.</abbr> <abbr title="Northamptonshire">Nhp.</abbr> <abbr title="Warwickshire">War.</abbr> <abbr title="Oxfordshire">Oxf.</abbr> <abbr title="East Anglia">e.An.</abbr> <abbr title="Suffolk">Suf.</abbr>), with
the same meaning. Others of his ‘low’ words yet current
are: ‘To Collogue, <abbr title="verb neuter">v.n.</abbr>... To wheedle; to flatter; to
please with kind words’; ‘A Clutter, <abbr title="noun substantive">n.s.</abbr>... A noise; a
bustle; a busy tumult; a hurry; a clamour’; ‘To dizen.
<abbr title="verb active">v.a.</abbr>... To dress; to deck; to rig out.’ On the other
hand, modern usage confirms Johnson’s opinion in the case
of: ‘Souse. <abbr title="adverb">adv.</abbr> With sudden violence. A low word’; ‘To
Swop. <abbr title="verb active">v.a.</abbr> [Of uncertain derivation.] To change; to exchange
one thing for another. A low word’; and so with many
other words, which are to the present day, not dialect, but
colloquial and slang expressions that have never worked
their way up into ‘polite usage’, as has been the better
fortune of: ‘To budge’; ‘To coax’; ‘Quandary’;
‘Touchy’; and a few more, which were once also under the
ban of Johnson’s opprobrium, and were each branded with
his stern, judicial dictum, ‘a low word’.</p>

The Survival of Rare Words
</div>

<p class="new_para">We have already seen that numbers of familiar words
which we were wont to look upon as dead bodies embalmed
in the prose or verse of bygone centuries, are yet alive and
active in the dialects of to-day. But not only have the
familiar words been thus preserved, but also, sometimes, the
rare and unfamiliar. Where scholars have been unable to
discern the true meaning, or where the sense has been merely
deduced from the context, the discovery of the living word
in some rustic dialect has supplied the missing clue, or turned
vague conjecture into well-grounded certainty. There exists
in Sussex and Hampshire the word <em>crundel</em>, used to denote
a ravine, or a strip of covert dividing open country, always
in a dip, usually with running water in the middle. In the
<cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Codex Diplomaticus</span></cite> edited by Kemble, more than sixty
<em>crundels</em> are mentioned, but the meaning of the word had
always remained a puzzle. Sweet, in his <cite>Anglo-Saxon
Dictionary</cite>, defines it as a cavity, a chalk-pit(?), a pond(?);<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
Bosworth-Toller as a barrow, a mound raised over graves
to protect them; Leo as a spring or well; Kemble as a
sort of watercourse, or a meadow through which a stream
flows. It was the discovery of the existence of the word in
the dialects which placed the correct meaning beyond doubt.
In the Old English epic poem <cite><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Beowulf</span></cite>, occurs the following
passage: <em><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Ofer þǣm hongiað hrinde bearwas</span></em>, Over which
[lake] hang ... woods. The question as to the meaning of
<em><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">hrinde</span></em> has formed the subject of frequent discussion, and
various translations have been suggested, e.g. barky,
rustling, placed in a ring or circle, standing in a ring, or
gnarled(?), <abbr title="vide">v.</abbr> <cite>Beowulf</cite>, by W. J. Sedgefield, Litt.D., 1910.
Dr. Richard Morris, however, proved fairly conclusively that
the right meaning should be rimy, frosty. The word <em><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">hrinde</span></em>
was taken to be a corrupt form of <abbr title="Old English">O.E.</abbr> <em><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">hrīmge</span></em>, rimy, covered
with hoar-frost, and this amended reading was adopted in
subsequent editions of the text. Now the word for hoar-frost
in several northern dialects is <em>rind</em>, and from a philological
point of view, it is quite possible to connect the two words,
and justify the retention of the <abbr title="manuscript">MS.</abbr> reading, whilst corroborating
the accepted translation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
Sir Gawayne and the Green Knight
</div>

<p class="new_para">About the middle of the fourteenth century were produced
four remarkable poems, <cite>Sir Gawayne and the Green Knight</cite>,
a romantic story of the adventures of an Arthurian knight;
<cite>Pearl</cite>, a Vision; <cite>Cleanness</cite>; and <cite>Patience</cite>, stories taken from
the Bible. We know nothing of the life of the author, we
do not even know his name. Perhaps the little ‘Marjory’
who ‘<span lang="enm" xml:lang="enm">lyfed not two yer in our thede</span> [country]’ was the
poet’s own daughter, and the <em>Pearl</em> the <em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">In Memoriam</span></em> outpouring
of his life’s sorrow. If so, it is the only shred of his
biography which we possess, and some scholars would rob
us even of that, by affirming that the lost ‘Pearl’ was purely
a poetic creation. We can only guess at the man through
his works. Judged by them, he appears to have been a
literary country gentleman, born and bred in Lancashire,
a man equally at home in his study, pen in hand, describing
armed knights, and embattled castles, the tumultuous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
surgings of the Deluge, and the woes of Jonah in the ‘<span lang="enm" xml:lang="enm">maw</span>’
of the ‘<span lang="enm" xml:lang="enm">wylde walterande whal</span>’; or, in the saddle, following
the ‘<span lang="enm" xml:lang="enm">wylde swyn</span>’, or ‘<span lang="enm" xml:lang="enm">reynarde</span>’ ‘<span lang="enm" xml:lang="enm">þe schrewe</span>’ to the sound
of horn and bugle and the ‘<span lang="enm" xml:lang="enm">glauerande glam of gedered
rachchez</span>’ [yelping cry of a pack of hounds]. He possessed,
on the one hand, a real vein of poetic imagination, coupled
with learning and knowledge, and on the other, all the instincts
of a keen sportsman.
He was a lover of nature and
outdoor life, with extraordinary powers of accurate observation,
and an artist’s eye for picturesque detail. Thus his
memory was stored with a rich and varied vocabulary
which the exigencies of his alliterative verse brought into
full play. Many of the words he used are not found recorded
anywhere else in literature, but they have remained in the
dialect of the district to which the poet belonged. <cite>Sir
Gawayne</cite> especially, by reason of its more secular subject-matter,
abounds in words which are common in the North-country
dialects of to-day, and it is these modern instances
which have brought to light previously hidden meanings,
and have confirmed contextual deductions, and thus enabled
us to appreciate more fully the skilful handling of a wide
range of vocabulary which characterizes this unknown poet,
sportsman, and man of letters. In the description of the
wondrous caparison of the Green Knight’s horse are mentioned
‘<span lang="enm" xml:lang="enm">his molaynes</span>’. The Glossary to the text gives this
word as signifying: round embossed ornaments, but with a
query. Stratmann’s <cite>Dictionary</cite> gives ‘<em><span lang="enm" xml:lang="enm">Molaine</span></em>, <abbr title="substantive">sb.</abbr>? some
ornament of a shield’. No other instance of the use of the
word occurs in literature, but it is found in the Midland
and South Midland spoken dialects: <em>Mullen</em>, the head-gear
of a horse; the bridle of a cart-horse. Similarly, ‘<span lang="enm" xml:lang="enm">toppyng</span>’,
another word peculiar to this poem. The Glossary and
Dictionary suggest the meanings ‘mane(?), or top, head(?)’;
the correct meaning as shown by the dialects is: a horse’s
forelock. When the Man in Green ‘<span lang="enm" xml:lang="enm">gedereȝ vp hys grymme
tole, Gawayn to smyte</span>’, he ‘<span lang="enm" xml:lang="enm">mynteȝ at hym maȝtyly</span>’, <abbr title="line">l.</abbr> 2290.
Obviously the verb ‘<span lang="enm" xml:lang="enm">mynt</span>’ means, as the Glossary says, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
aim, or strike, but the more exact sense, and the one required
by the story, is shown by the modern dialect <em>mint</em> (<abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr> <abbr title="Ireland">Irel.</abbr>
and <abbr title="north Country">n.Cy.</abbr> dialects), to make a feigned attempt at, to make
a movement as if to strike a blow but without doing it. The
Green Knight had appointed his ‘<span lang="enm" xml:lang="enm">grene chapelle</span>’ as the
place where Sir Gawayne was to receive this blow, and it
proves to be ‘<span lang="enm" xml:lang="enm">nobot an olde caue, Or a creuisse of an olde
cragge</span>’:</p>

the rest of the speech, and it adds a realistic touch, which
was wanting in ‘desert’. Sir Gawayne was looking into

Surnames and Place-names
</div>

<p class="new_para">Before leaving the subject of the preservation of old words
in the dialects, one other store-chamber of words no longer
current in the standard speech is worth a passing notice.
Many old words which have ceased to be used as common
nouns, have become crystallized in surnames, and it is
interesting to compare them with the existing cognates
in the dialects. I am aware that any attempt to go
etymologizing among surnames or place-names is treading
on dangerous ground. It is so easy to rush in
with a fair sounding derivation, which is in reality nothing
more than a worthless guess. I shall not, therefore, venture
far afield.</p>

<p class="new_para">Amongst the names here brought together, I have not
included those which have now no living representative, as
for example: Hordern, which is the <abbr title="Old English">O.E.</abbr> <em><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">hord-ærn</span></em>, a
treasury, a storeroom, <abbr title="literally">lit.</abbr> a hoard-house. The word
<em><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">ærn</span></em> is, as far as I know, wholly obsolete, all except its
final <em>n</em> remaining in <em>barn</em>, literally, a barley-house.
Or again, Newbottle, Newbold, which contain the forms
<abbr title="Old English">O.E.</abbr> <em><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">botl</span></em>, <em><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">bold</span></em>, a house, a dwelling, now no longer used
as a simple word, remaining only in surnames and place-names.</p>

Words denoting Occupations
</div>

<p class="new_para">The <abbr title="Old English">O.E.</abbr> suffix <em><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">-estre</span></em> was originally used in forming
feminine <em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nomina agentis</span></em>, but already in later <abbr title="Old English">O.E.</abbr> we find
<em><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">bæcestre</span></em> used to denote a male as well as a female baker, the
name changing hands with the trade. During the <abbr title="Middle English">M.E.</abbr>
period <em><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">-estre</span></em> became <em><span lang="enm" xml:lang="enm">-ster</span></em> and was felt to be only an emphatic
form of the masculine <em><span lang="enm" xml:lang="enm">-er</span></em>, and could be used indifferently
for men or women, so that when baking, brewing, dyeing,
weaving, <abbr class="silent" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, ceased to be feminine pursuits, the terms
<span lang="enm" xml:lang="enm">bakester</span>, <span lang="enm" xml:lang="enm">brewester</span>, <span lang="enm" xml:lang="enm">litester</span>, <span lang="enm" xml:lang="enm">webster</span> ceased to convey any
tinge of feminine gender, and in course of time they became
the surnames Baxter, Brewster, Litster, Webster. To sit
and spin was, however, an occupation to which the ladies
held undisputed claim, and spinster continued to designate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
a woman as distinct and apart from a man, even when the
trade was forgotten, so the term has never become a surname. As a common noun <em>backster</em> for baker is known in a few
northern dialects, but its use is dying out. In the form
<em>bakester</em> it is, however, used in Cornwall. In the same
districts <em>brewster</em> for brewer holds a similar position. <em>Litster</em>
for dyer is practically obsolete now, though the verb <em>lit</em>, to
dye, remains in Scotland and the North. It is a Scandinavian
word, from <abbr title="Old Norse">O.N.</abbr> <em><span lang="non" xml:lang="non">lita</span></em>, to dye, already occurring in <abbr title="Middle English">M.E.</abbr>, <abbr title="compare">cp.</abbr>

<span class="sub_head">ARCHAIC MEANINGS AND FORMS IN THE DIALECTS</span></h2>

<p class="new_para">So far we have considered only those words which, whether
recently or long ago, have left the ranks of standard modern
English and become ‘dialect’. But another wide field for
study opens up when we come to look at common standard
English words as they are used in the dialects. We shall
find that the dialects have frequently preserved a well-authenticated
old meaning which we have let slip, and now
express by some quite different word or phrase. What may
now sound to us like a perverted sense is often historically
correct, for whereas learned influences, the introduction of
foreign words—which makes for further specialization and
differentiation of meaning—and the general march of civilization
affecting manners, customs, and habits of thought, all
tend to divert the normal course of language, the dialects
have meanwhile kept the noiseless tenor of their way unmolested.
Thus it may often happen that it is we of the
literary speech who use a word in a perverted or specialized
sense, while the unlearned rustic is keeping to one which
has been handed down steadily from father to son since the
days of Wyclif or Shakespeare, or to go still further back,
since the days of Alfred or Chaucer. A few examples of
these words used with their older meanings are: <em>able</em> (<abbr title="north Country">n.Cy.</abbr>
<abbr title="Northumberland">Nhb.</abbr> <abbr title="Durham">Dur.</abbr> <abbr title="Cumberland">Cum.</abbr> <abbr title="Westmorland">Wm.</abbr> <abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr> <abbr title="Lancashire">Lan.</abbr> <abbr title="Warwickshire">War.</abbr> <abbr title="Herefordshire">Hrf.</abbr>), well-to-do, rich,

Preservation of Historical Forms
</div>

<p class="new_para">Side by side with these historical meanings preserved in
the dialects, are the historical forms. Many a word which
we meet in the dialects in some unfamiliar shape, can be
shown to be no mere vulgar mispronunciation or misspelling,
but a genuine old form, once under distinguished patronage
in our earlier literature. Or again, formations which appear
to be ignorant errors in grammar can be shown to be grammatically
regular, the divergence of the standard form being
due to analogy, or some other influence. It is surprising to
find what a number of cases there are where a word in literary
English has become corrupt, whilst in the dialects it has
followed its normal development. To take some examples of
these justifiable dialect forms: <em>alablaster</em> (<abbr title="north and midlands">n. and midl.</abbr>

Standard English Words compared with Dialect Equivalents
</div>

<p class="new_para">Amongst these dialect words which differ in form and
pronunciation from their equivalents in the standard language
are many French words, borrowed several centuries
ago either from Old French, or through the medium of
Anglo-Norman French. Meanwhile, we of the standard
speech have perhaps re-borrowed the word in a more
modern shape, or re-modelled it after the pattern of its Latin
cognate, or, where in older times the standard vocabulary included
two forms side by side, we have since discarded one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
them, and left it to drop into obscurity. Regarded thus,
the dialect form can take its legitimate place as the second
half of a doublet, with as good a title to name and fame as
the half that remained in the ranks of the literary vocabulary.
There are quantities of doublets of this nature still in everyday
standard use, but because we are familiar with each half
of the pair, we are not tempted to regard one of them as
vulgar or corrupt because it differs from the other. Examples
of these literary doublets are: caitiff and captive;
mayor and major; parson and person; royal and regal;
<abbr class="silent" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, <abbr class="silent" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> In all these cases a divergence of meaning has
taken place, so that each member of the pair maintains a
separate existence, but in the following examples from the
dialects, I have for the most part selected those words
where the meaning is the same as that of the literary form:

Apparent Irregularities due to Scandinavian Influence

<p class="new_para">Further, there are the dialect words in which the apparent

<p class="new_para">We have often been told, or we have read in newspaper
reviews and suchlike works, that the rustic vernacular is
indigenous to the soil, mostly raw material in the rough, but

when we examine the whole vocabulary in detail, we find it
contains a very considerable admixture of foreign elements.

the dialects throughout the country, in varying proportions

The Development of ‘Mooch’
</div>

<p class="new_para">A loan-word which has undergone a curious development
of meanings is the common dialect word <em>mooch</em> (in <abbr title="general dialect">gen. dial.</abbr>
use in <abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr> and <abbr title="England">Eng.</abbr>), <em>meech</em>, or <em>mitch</em>. In <abbr title="Old English">O.E.</abbr> there must
have been an unrecorded form <em><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">mȳcan</span></em>, which gave the dialect
form <em>mitch</em>. This <abbr title="Old English">O.E.</abbr> <em><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">mȳcan</span></em> corresponds to the <abbr title="Old High German">O.H.G.</abbr>
<em><span lang="goh" xml:lang="goh">mūhhan</span></em>, to lie lurking secretly, to waylay a person with
intent to do him bodily harm, a word which remains in the
Modern German <em><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Meuchelmord</span></em>. The German word passed
into Northern French, and underwent the Norman-French
change of <em>hh</em> [<em>ch</em> as in <abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr> <em>loch</em>] to <em>tch</em> [as in <em>such</em>], becoming
<em><span lang="xno" xml:lang="xno">moucher</span></em>. In this stage the Normans brought the word to
this country, where it developed a curious category of
meanings: 1. To idle and loaf about, generally with the idea of
seeing what one can pick up on the sly; to pilfer, e.g. That
owd black cat goes mouchin’ about, in an’ out uv folkses
’ousen, ’er’ll sure to get shot one uv these daays. Hence
<em>moocher</em>, a pilferer, a loafer, one who dogs another by stealth;
a beggar; a hawker. 2. To play truant, especially to play
truant in order to gather blackberries; to absent oneself
from business, e.g. My lad’s been mouching again. Hence
<em>moocher</em>, a truant from school, especially one who plays<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
truant in order to gather blackberries; hence a gatherer of
blackberries, a blackberry-moocher. 3. In the Imperative,
<em>mooch</em> means Be off! 4. The phrase <em>on the mooch</em> means
gone off loafing. 5. <em>Mooch</em> <abbr title="substantive">sb.</abbr> means a blackberry. Meanwhile
a further development in form took place on the
Continent; the Norman-French <em><span lang="xno" xml:lang="xno">moucher</span></em> passed into Central
French, and underwent the ordinary change of <em>tch</em> to <em>ss</em>,
thereby becoming <em><span lang="fro" xml:lang="fro">musser</span></em>, and later <em><span lang="frm" xml:lang="frm">muser</span></em>, to lurk in a corner,
preserved in the Modern French reflexive verb <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">se muser</span></em>, to
play truant. From <em><span lang="fro" xml:lang="fro">musser</span></em> was derived the substantive
<em><span lang="frm" xml:lang="frm">musse</span></em>, defined in Littré as a narrow passage through a wall
or a hedge for hares, rabbits, and other game. This Central
French word <em><span lang="frm" xml:lang="frm">musse</span></em> was brought over to England in the reign
of Henry VII, as a hunting term, together with many other
words of the same kind. It is common in English works of
the seventeenth century in the form <em>muse</em>, familiar to us
in the old English proverbial saying:</p>

original <abbr title="Old English">O.E.</abbr> <em><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">mȳcan</span></em>, developed meanings on the same lines

traced back to the <abbr title="Old English">O.E.</abbr> period. <em>Bannock</em> (<abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr> <abbr title="Ireland">Irel.</abbr> <abbr title="Northumberland">Nhb.</abbr>
<abbr title="Cumberland">Cum.</abbr> <abbr title="Westmorland">Wm.</abbr> <abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr> <abbr title="Lancashire">Lan.</abbr> <abbr title="Cheshire">Chs.</abbr> <abbr title="Staffordshire">Stf.</abbr> <abbr title="East Anglia">e.An.</abbr> <abbr title="Hampshire">Hmp.</abbr> <abbr title="Wiltshire">Wil.</abbr> <abbr title="Somerset">Som.</abbr> <abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr>),
a cake composed of oatmeal or barley mixed with water and
baked on a girdle, is <abbr title="Old English">O.E.</abbr> <em><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">bannuc</span></em>; and <em>brat</em> (<abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr> <abbr title="Ireland">Irel.</abbr> <abbr title="Northumberland">Nhb.</abbr>

<abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr> <abbr title="Pembrokeshire">Pem.</abbr>), a child’s pinafore, a large coarse apron made
with sleeves, worn by workers in factories, is found in the
Northumbrian Gospels of the tenth century, <em><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">bratt</span></em> ‘pallium’,
<cite><abbr title="Matthew">Matt.</abbr></cite> <abbr title="chapter 5 verse 40">v. 40</abbr>. Perhaps the most interesting of the early
Celtic loan-words is the word <em>tallet</em>, meaning a hay-loft,
especially one over a stable, also used of the space immediately
under the roof in any building, but not applied to a ceiled
room of any kind. It is originally a Latin word, <em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">tabulatum</span></em>,
a boarded floor, and must have been a relic of the Roman
occupation, picked up by the ancient Britons, and preserved
by them in a modified form, <abbr title="compare">cp.</abbr> <abbr title="Welsh">Wel.</abbr> <em><span lang="cy" xml:lang="cy">taflod</span></em>, a hay-loft, <abbr title="Old Irish">O.Ir.</abbr>
<em><span lang="sga" xml:lang="sga">taibled</span></em>, a story. Then later it was adopted by the Anglo-Saxon
invaders, and became the English word <em>tallet</em>, which
is found to-day in common use in the dialects of Cheshire
and all the <abbr title="west midlands and south-west">w.midl. and sw.</abbr> counties, that is, in all the
counties near the Welsh border. The remarkable point
about the preservation of this word is that it never once
occurs in the whole range of English literature down to the
nineteenth century, when Blackmore introduced it in his
<cite>Lorna Doone</cite>. Through all these centuries it has steadily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
persisted in the spoken language without any help from the
world of letters, linking the modern rustic to the early Briton
and the subjects of Julius Caesar.</p>

Celtic Words in Scottish Speech
</div>

<p class="new_para">The dialects of Scotland have adopted a certain amount
of Gaelic words into current speech, for example: <em>fuilteachs</em>,
<em>fultachs</em>, <abbr title="substantive plural">sb.pl.</abbr> a period partly in January and partly in
February, according to ‘Old Style’ reckoning, now wholly
in February. If the weather is fine during the <em>fultachs</em>, a bad
summer and a cold wet harvest may be expected; but
stormy <em>fultachs</em> betoken a good summer, <abbr title="Gaelic">Gael.</abbr> <em><span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">faoilteach</span></em>,
the last fortnight of winter, and first fortnight of spring,
proverbial for variableness. <em>Glack</em>, a ravine, glen, <abbr title="Gaelic">Gael.</abbr> <em><span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">glac</span></em>,
a hollow, a narrow valley; <em>oye</em>, a grandchild, <abbr title="Gaelic">Gael.</abbr> <em><span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">ogha</span></em>;
<em>skeeny</em>, pack-thread, twine, <abbr title="Gaelic">Gael.</abbr> <em><span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">sgéinnidh</span></em>, twine, flax or
hemp thread; <em>taisch</em>, the voice of a person about to die,
second sight, <abbr title="Gaelic">Gael.</abbr> <em><span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">taibhs</span></em>, a vision, apparition, ghost.
Similarly, modern Irish has incorporated certain Old Irish
words, such as: <em>gra(h)</em>, affection, love, fondness, <abbr title="Irish">Ir.</abbr> <em><span lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">gradh</span></em>,
love; <em>grafan</em>, a small axe with the edge turned across like
an adze, used for grubbing, <abbr title="Irish">Ir.</abbr> <em><span lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">grafán</span></em>; <em>miscaun</em>, a lump of
butter, <abbr title="Irish">Ir.</abbr> <em><span lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">miosgán</span></em>, a small dish of butter; <em>partan</em>, the common
crab, <abbr title="Irish">Ir.</abbr> <em><span lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">partán</span></em>, <em><span lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">portán</span></em>, a crab; <em>shanagh</em>, <em>shanacus</em>,
a gossip, chat, talk, <abbr title="Irish">Ir.</abbr> <em><span lang="ga" xml:lang="ga">seanchus</span></em>, history, genealogy, every
kind of knowledge. From Wales a few Welsh words have
been taken over into the English dialects, for instance:
<em>cader</em> (<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr> <abbr title="Lancashire">Lan.</abbr> <abbr title="Cheshire">Chs.</abbr> <abbr title="Staffordshire">Stf.</abbr> <abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr> Cor.), a cradle, <abbr title="Welsh">Wel.</abbr> <em><span lang="cy" xml:lang="cy">cadair</span></em>,
a chair, <em><span lang="cy" xml:lang="cy">cadair fagu</span></em>, a cradle; <em>keffel</em> (<abbr title="north Country">n.Cy.</abbr> <abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr> <abbr title="Warwickshire">War.</abbr> <abbr title="Worcestershire">Wor.</abbr>
<abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr> <abbr title="Somerset">Som.</abbr>), a horse, generally an old or inferior one, <abbr title="Welsh">Wel.</abbr>
<em><span lang="cy" xml:lang="cy">ceffyl</span></em>, a horse. The form <em>flannen</em> for flannel, which is in
general dialect use in Scotland, Ireland, and England, is also
Welsh, and not a corruption of the standard pronunciation,
<abbr title="compare">cp.</abbr> <abbr title="Welsh">Wel.</abbr> <em><span lang="cy" xml:lang="cy">gwlanen</span></em>, woollen material. Old Cornish as a language
ceased to be spoken about the end of the eighteenth
century, but here and there can be found traces of it in the
modern Cornish vocabulary, for example: <em>mabyer</em>, a young
hen, a pullet, a chicken, <abbr title="Old Cornish">O.Cor.</abbr> <em><span lang="oco" xml:lang="oco">mab</span></em> + <em><span lang="oco" xml:lang="oco">iar</span></em>, i.e. the son of a hen;

in health, palsied, <abbr class="silent" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, <abbr title="Old Cornwall">O.Cor.</abbr> <em><span lang="oco" xml:lang="oco">palch</span></em>, weak, sickly; <em>pilm</em>,
dust, dry dust, fluff, <abbr title="Old Cornish">O.Cor.</abbr> <em><span lang="oco" xml:lang="oco">pilm</span></em>, flying dust like flour;
<em>quilkin</em>, a frog, <abbr title="Old Cornish">O.Cor.</abbr> <em><span lang="oco" xml:lang="oco">cwilcen</span></em>; <em>subban</em>, a sop, <abbr title="Old Cornwall">O.Cor.</abbr> <em><span lang="oco" xml:lang="oco">suben</span></em>,
a mass, a morsel.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
Latin Words in the Dialects
</div>

<p class="new_para">The French and Scandinavian loan-words constitute by
far the greater proportion of the foreign element in the
dialects, and next come the Celtic words. Beside these, the
borrowings from other languages are of little or no importance,
beyond the fact of their adoption. It strikes one
with surprise, for instance, to meet a Greek word like <em><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">nous</span></em>
in common dialect use all over England, e.g. Th’ ’ead o’ un’s
a-put on vitty, there’s some nouse about he (<abbr title="Somerset">Som.</abbr>), or:
T’yent no good to ax he to do’t, vor ’e a-yent got no nowse
(<abbr title="Berkshire">Brks.</abbr>). Latin words have crept into English dialects from
various sources. Some have drifted down from the Old
English period, e.g. <em>sicker</em> (<abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr> <abbr title="Ireland">Irel.</abbr> <abbr title="Northumberland">Nhb.</abbr> <abbr title="Cumberland">Cum.</abbr> <abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr>), secure,
safe, which is <abbr title="Old English">O.E.</abbr> <em><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">sicor</span></em>, secure, certain, from <abbr title="Latin">Lat.</abbr> <em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">securus</span></em>;
<em>taffel</em> (<abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr>), a small table, which is the same word as <abbr title="Old English">O.E.</abbr>
<em><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">tæfl</span></em>, a chess-board, from <abbr title="Latin">Lat.</abbr> <em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">tabula</span></em>. Others have come
through the medium of Old Norse, e.g. <em>almous</em>, <em>aumous</em> (<abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr>
<abbr title="Ireland">Irel.</abbr> and <abbr title="north">n.</abbr> counties), money or food bestowed in charity, a
small portion, <abbr class="silent" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, from <abbr title="Old Norse">O.N.</abbr> <em><span lang="non" xml:lang="non">almusa</span></em>, beside the standard
English form <em>alms</em>, from <abbr title="Old English">O.E.</abbr> <em><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">ælmysse</span></em>, <em><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">ælmesse</span></em>, from a
<abbr title="popular Latin"> pop. Lat.</abbr> *<em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">alimosina</span></em>; <em>scrive</em> (<abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr> <abbr title="Northumberland">Nhb.</abbr> <abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr>), to write, from <abbr title="Old Norse">O.N.</abbr>
<em><span lang="non" xml:lang="non">skrifa</span></em>, from <abbr title="Latin">Lat.</abbr> <em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">scribere</span></em>. Some are legal terms, e.g. <em>mittimus</em>
(<abbr title="Westmorland">Wm.</abbr> <abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr>), a legal summons, a notice to quit, a dismissal
from service, e.g. Poor fella, ah pity yon man, ah du really:
t’landlord’s sent him hiz mittimus to leeav; <em>siserary</em> (<abbr title="Ireland">Irel.</abbr>
<abbr title="Durham">Dur.</abbr> <abbr title="Northamptonshire">Nhp.</abbr> <abbr title="East Anglia">e.An.</abbr> <abbr title="Suffolk">Suf.</abbr> <abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr>), a violent scolding, a severe blow,
which is a dialect corruption and use of the legal term
<em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">certiorari</span></em>, a corruption found in Smollett’s <cite>Humphrey
Clinker</cite>, <abbr title="compare">cp.</abbr> ‘I have gi’en the dirty slut a siserary.’ Others,
again, are Church words, e.g. <em>cirage-money</em> (<abbr title="Cheshire">Chs.</abbr>), church
rates, originally the equivalent of ‘wax-shot’, a duty
formerly paid towards the charge of wax candles in churches,
from <abbr title="Medieval Latin">M.Lat.</abbr> <em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ceragium</span></em>, ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quod cerae nomine praestabatur
ecclesiis ad luminarium concinnationem</span>,’ Ducange; <em>calends</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
(<abbr title="Worcestershire">Wor.</abbr> <abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr> <abbr title="Herefordshire">Hrf.</abbr>), a name given in certain places to the footpath
leading to the entrance of the church, from <abbr title="Medieval Latin">M.Lat.</abbr>
<em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">kalenda</span></em>, ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Initium cuiusvis rei, puta, Locus ubi territorium
aliquod incipit</span>,’ Ducange. A small sprinkling of Dutch
words can be found, such as: <em>dwile</em> (<abbr title="East Anglia">e.An.</abbr>), a coarse house-flannel,
any coarse rubbing-rag, a mop, <abbr title="Dutch">Du.</abbr> <em><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">dweyl</span></em>, a clout to
wash the floor, <em>stok-dweyl</em>, a mop; <em>frow</em> (<abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr> <abbr title="Ireland">Irel.</abbr> <abbr title="Northumberland">Nhb.</abbr> Cum-<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr>
<abbr title="Lancashire">Lan.</abbr>), a big, fat woman, <abbr title="Dutch">Du.</abbr> <em><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">vrouw</span></em>, a woman, wife.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
Poetic Words in Dialect Use
</div>

<p class="new_para">Another feature of the dialect vocabulary which is worth
a passing notice, is the existence therein of words which we
are wont to regard as too poetical, or too literary for everyday
use. We should fear to be considered affected, and
given to a habit of interlarding our conversation with quotations
from books, if we called a song-thrush a <em>mavis</em>, or a
<em>throstle</em>, and spoke of a <em>merle</em> or an <em>ousel</em> instead of saying
blackbird, yet all these four are extremely common dialect
terms. In parts of Yorkshire dialect-speakers call honeysuckle
<em>eglantine</em>, as Milton did in <cite>L’Allegro</cite>; and in certain
southern counties a stream is called a <em>bourn</em>, reminding us of
Milton’s ‘<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">bosky bourn</span>’; the two words would not, however,
be still heard in conjunction with one another, for <em>bosky</em> is
confined to the northern dialects. In a number of counties
from north to south <em>mead</em> is a common term for a field, a
meadow, e.g. The beeses is i’ the mead; similarly <em>delve</em> is
a common verb for dig, <em>dight</em> for prepare, <em>hie</em> for hasten,
e.g. Hie thee, Sarah, hie thee, and bring me a sope o’ beer,
aw’m welly [well-nigh] kilt wi’ droot (<abbr title="Cheshire">Chs.</abbr>); <em>lap</em> for wrap;
<em>rive</em> for tear; <em>rue</em> for regret, e.g. I’ve never rued it but once,
and that’s ever sin; <em>wax</em> for grow, e.g. He’s waxed sair sin aa
seed him last (<abbr title="Northumberland">Nhb.</abbr>), Ah wax warm (<abbr title="Suffolk">Suf.</abbr>). <em>Sear</em>, <abbr title="adjective">adj.</abbr> withered,
dry, is common in East Anglia. A Sussex rhyme runs:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="p_line">Burn ash-wood green,</div>
    <div class="p_line">’Tis fire for a Queen;</div>
    <div class="p_line">Burn ash-wood sare,</div>
    <div class="p_line">’Twool make a man swear.</div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p class="cont">There is a ring of poetry in the mere sound of such a word
as <em>dimble</em> (<abbr title="Derbyshire">Der.</abbr> <abbr title="Nottinghamshire">Not.</abbr> <abbr title="Leicestershire">Lei.</abbr>) for dingle, an echo of Ben Jonson’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
line: ‘<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Within a gloomy dimble she doth dwell</span>’; and the
expression <em>a wimpling burn</em> (<abbr title="north">n.</abbr> counties) seems to carry
with it the note of fresh, running water.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
Words of Academic Character
</div>

<p class="new_para">Beside these, are the words with a savour of academic
learning such as: <em>accord</em> (<abbr title="Worcestershire">Wor.</abbr> <abbr title="Herefordshire">Hrf.</abbr>) for agree, e.g. ’Im an’
’er can’t accard together no waay; <em>element</em> (<abbr title="north and south-west">n. and sw.</abbr>
counties) for sky, atmosphere. A Somersetshire man describing
a thunder-storm said: Th’element was all to a flicker.
The Yorkshire proverbial saying: Ah could na more do it
ner ah could fly into t’element, is worth recording before the
oncoming cloud of aeroplanes has made us forget that it
could ever typify the impossible. The term <em>cabal</em> can be
used to describe a group of people met together for gossip,
e.g. There wor Jane, an’ Hoppy, an’ Sal, an’ the hull cabal
on ’em i’ the lane (<abbr title="Nottinghamshire">Not.</abbr>), or it can signify a great noise of
talking, <abbr class="silent" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, e.g. They war makkin’ a fine auld cabal at
t’public-hoose last neet (<abbr title="Westmorland">Wm.</abbr>). In some parts of Ireland
a <em>gladiathor</em> is a well-known term for a fine fellow, a roysterer,
a fighter, e.g. Whin I comes acrass a man who has two or
three hundred pounds, an’ sees all his capers an’ antics,
I says to meself, What a gladiathur ye are. But here we
have to deal also with the change of meaning which the
literary word has undergone, and as the majority of what
we have termed learned words are used in a transferred
sense in the dialects, the remainder of our examples must
be carried over into the next chapter.</p>

Clever, Comical, Conceit, Discourse
</div>

<p class="new_para">The linguistic study of the dialects becomes an entertaining
pursuit when we turn our attention to the dialect usage of
literary words in a sense other than that to which we are
accustomed in standard English. This can only be illustrated
by quotations, for only thus can the true inwardness of the
dialect meaning be appreciated. <em>Adapted</em> (<abbr title="Hampshire">Hmp.</abbr>) means
accustomed to: a man adapted to pigs is a man experienced
in the rearing of swine; <em>agreeable</em> (<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr>) means suitable, to
one’s taste or liking, e.g. Noo, reach to, an’ mak’ yersels agreeable,
an’ if ye dean’t lahk it lay back, is a friendly invitation
to guests at the board to help themselves to what they fancy;
an <em>auction</em> (<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr> <abbr title="Lancashire">Lan.</abbr> <abbr title="Cheshire">Chs.</abbr> <abbr title="Staffordshire">Stf.</abbr>) is a dirty or untidy place or
room, a meaning which no doubt has had its origin in the
state of dirt and disorder occasioned by a public sale: Ah
nivver seed sitch a auction i’ all my life as their hahse is,
t’furnitur’s onnywheear but whear it sud be; <em>cake</em> (<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr>) is
bread, whilst <em>bread</em> means oatcake, e.g. Etten cake’s sooin forgotten
is a proverbial saying; to <em>call</em> a person (<abbr title="general dialect">gen. dial.</abbr> use)
means to abuse him to his face, to abuse any one behind his
back is to <em>illify</em>. A Yorkshire minister preaching on Christian
forbearance counselled his hearers thus: If they call ya, tak
neea heed on’t, bud if they bunch [kick] ya, or cobble ya
wi’ steeans, gan ti t’justice, an’ a’e deean wi’t at yance.
<em>Casualty</em> (<abbr title="north, mid and west dialects">n. m. and w. dials.</abbr>) is used as an adjective meaning
precarious, risky, uncertain, not to be relied upon, e.g. Cauves
is cazzlety things to rear; a <em>Christian</em> (<abbr title="gereral dialects">gen. dials.</abbr>) is a human
being as distinguished from one of the lower animals,
e.g. W’y ’e’d get on that wall, said a woman of a favourite
dog, an’ bark like a krischun ’e ’ood, ’e knowed so well who

(<abbr title="Worcestershire">Wor.</abbr> <abbr title="Herefordshire">Hrf.</abbr> <abbr title="Gloucestershire">Glo.</abbr> <abbr title="Bedfordshire">Bdf.</abbr>) means unwell, out of sorts, e.g. I’ve
felt bad and comical a many days; used of roads (<abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr>) it
signifies bad, dangerous, e.g. It’s a comical road, specially if
theer comes on a mug [fog]; a <em>conceit</em> (<abbr title="Ireland">Irel.</abbr> <abbr title="north and midlands">n. and midl.</abbr>
counties) is an opinion, idea, fancy, e.g. If a wanst teks a

be used as a verb in a like sense, e.g. What do you understand
by being confirmed? Why, I consate I’ll have to fight the
devil by mysel’; <em>dead</em> (<abbr title="Ireland">Irel.</abbr> <abbr title="Herefordshire">Hrf.</abbr> <abbr title="Gloucestershire">Glo.</abbr> <abbr title="Cornwall">Cor.</abbr>) means faint,
unconscious, e.g. I was dead ever so long; a <em>deaf</em> nut (<abbr title="north midlands and south-west">n. midl.
and sw.</abbr> counties) is one without a kernel, e.g. He does not
look as if he lived on deaf nuts is said of a man who looks
well-fed and prosperous; to <em>disannul</em> (<abbr title="north, midlands, west and east">n. midl. w. and e.</abbr>
counties) means to abolish, destroy, e.g. Mr. B. has disannulled
the pigsty; or to disarrange, inconvenience,
e.g. Yo’ can come in, yo’ oonna disannul the ladies; <em>discourse</em>
(<abbr title="Lincolnshire">Lin.</abbr> <abbr title="Somerset">Som.</abbr> <abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr>) is bad language, e.g. Of all the discoose
ever I yurd in my life, that there beat everything; a <em>dormouse</em>

as jubous as ’er’s scrimmity [niggardly], weighs the flour out,
an’ then the bread after it’s baked, be’appen ’er thinks as
I should ate the duff; a <em>faggot</em> (<abbr title="midlands and southern">midl. and s.</abbr> counties) is a dish,
usually a small cake or rissole made of the fry, liver, or inferior
portions of a pig or sheep, e.g. ‘Hot faggots to-night’ is
a not uncommon notice to be seen, for example, in the
windows of small eating-houses in Malvern, Cheltenham, or
Oxford; a <em>fig</em> (<abbr title="Berkshire">Brks.</abbr> <abbr title="Hampshire">Hmp.</abbr> <abbr title="Wiltshire">Wil.</abbr> <abbr title="Somerset">Som.</abbr> <abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr> <abbr title="Cornwall">Cor.</abbr>) is a raisin,
hence <em>figgy-pudding</em> stands for plum-pudding. A woman
who made plum-puddings for sale, placed this notice in her
shop-window: ‘Figgy pudden wan appeny a slice, more
figgier wan penny a slice.’ It is a common saying that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
a Cornishman’s idea of happiness is: A fresh preacher and
a figgy-pudding every Sunday. <em>False</em> (<abbr title="north and midlands">n. and midl.</abbr> counties),
applied to children and animals, means sharp, shrewd, clever,
precocious, e.g. as fause as a Christian, often said of a clever
animal; <em>fierce</em> (<abbr title="midlands and East Anglia">midl. and e.An.</abbr>) means brisk, lively, in good
health, and is usually applied to babies, it can also signify
brave, valiant, mettlesome, as in the ironical simile: as
fierce as a maggot; <em>fog</em> (in <abbr title="general dialect">gen. dial.</abbr> use) is the aftermath,
the second crop of hay, or the long grass left standing in
the fields during winter. In a <abbr title="Middle English">M.E.</abbr> account of the fate of
Nebuchadnezzar we read: ‘He fares forth on alle faure
[fours], fogge watȝ his mete.’ A printed notice conspicuous
in the market-square of Settle a few years ago advertised
‘120 acres of fog for Sale’. <em>Flippant</em> (<abbr title="Dorset">Dor.</abbr> <abbr title="Somerset">Som.</abbr> <abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr>) is
used of rods or sticks in the sense of pliant, used of persons
it means quick, nimble; <em>frightful</em> (<abbr title="Herefordshire">Hrf.</abbr> <abbr title="East Anglia">e.An.</abbr> <abbr title="Somerset">Som.</abbr>) means
timid, easily frightened, e.g. Lauk! Miss, how frightful you
are! said by a homely wench when Miss screams at a toad

Literary Words in the Dialects with Peculiar Idiomatic Uses

The poor girl was seen wandering about the fields in the early
morning, and when the mistress appeared and reproached her
for the unlighted fires, she explained that she had been searching

exclaimed the judge. ‘Yes, sur, and he is a banker, that
I’ll take my Bible oath on, for I seed him mellin’ doon kids

way the fox went; <em>shale</em> (<abbr title="west Yorkshire">w.Yks.</abbr>) denotes a fire-lighter,
made by cutting down a piece of soft deal wood into something
resembling a tree-fern. A showman proclaimed that
within his show we were to be told something worth a pound
for a penny. Inside was a man cutting shales, and all he
said was: Always cut from you and you’ll never cut yourself.
To <em>simper</em> (<abbr title="Ireland">Irel.</abbr> <abbr title="west Yorkshire">w.Yks.</abbr> <abbr title="East Anglia">e.An.</abbr>) is to simmer, <abbr title="compare">cp.</abbr> ‘<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">I symper,

A <em>wig</em> (in <abbr title="general dialect">gen. dial.</abbr> use) is a kind of cake or bun, a <em>plain wig</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>

The Lincolnshire version of the common nursery rhyme runs
as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="p_line">Tom, Tom, the baker’s son,</div>
    <div class="p_line">Stole a wig, and away he run;</div>
    <div class="p_line">The wig was eat, and Tom was beat,</div>
    <div class="p_line">And Tom went roaring down the street.</div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">
‘Pig’ or ‘Wig’
</div>


<p class="cont">The ordinary version substitutes ‘pig’ for ‘wig’, and
makes Tom’s father a ‘piper’. It is a question for textual
critics to settle, but natural sequence of idea and detail is on
the side of the ‘wig’-version being the original one; and
it is easy to see how in a literary nursery, authority would
say that the most omnivorous of small boys could not eat
a periwig, and therefore the word must be pig. This change
once made, Tom’s father becomes a piper for the sake of
alliteration, rather than because there is any historical
connexion between a piper and a pig.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
Alliterative Phrases
</div>

<p class="new_para">A love of alliteration and rhyme in phrase and compound
has always been characteristic of English as a whole. We
tend naturally to say weary and worn, or sad and sorrowful,
and we cling to compounds like helter-skelter and pell-mell.
We even begin the education of our babies by teaching them
to call a dog a bow-wow, and a horse a gee-gee. It is not,
therefore, surprising to find this prevalence still more marked
in the dialects, where all normal tendencies have fuller sway
than in the standard language. Some of the alliterative
compounds are very expressive. A few examples are:
<em>chim-cham</em> (<abbr title="Somerset">Som.</abbr> <abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr>), undecided talk, e.g. You niver can’t
get no sense like out o’ un, cause he’s always so vull o’
chim-cham, which was said of a certain candidate for
Parliament; <em>easy-osie</em> (<abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr>), easy-going, e.g. He was an
easy-osie bodie, a kind of we’ve-aye-been-providit-for-and-sae-will-we-yet
sort of man; <em>feery-fary</em> (<abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr>), tumult, noise,
passion, <abbr title="compare">cp.</abbr> ‘<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Cupido ... Quha reft me, and left me In sik
a feirie-farye</span>,’ Montgomerie, <cite>Cherrie</cite>, 1597; <em>flim-flam</em> (<abbr title="Somerset">Som.</abbr>
<abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr>), idle talk, nonsense, e.g. Don’t thee ever tell up no
such flim-flam stuff, else nobody ’ont never harky to thee, nif
ever thee’s a-got wit vor to tell sense; <em>giddle-gaddle</em> (<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr>
<abbr title="Cheshire">Chs.</abbr>), a contrivance used instead of a stile or gate, an
effective bar to cattle and a trial to stout persons; <em>giff-gaff</em>

used especially in the proverbial saying: giff-gaff makes
good friends. A farmer said in reference to a douceur which
his landlord’s agent appeared to expect: Chiff-chaff, feer
an’ squeer, that’s roight enew, but this here giff-gaff grease
i’ fist sort o’ woo’k doon’t dew for may. The word is found
as far back as the year 1549 in one of Latimer’s sermons:

(<abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr>), awry, perverse; <em>midge-madge</em> (<abbr title="Isle of Wight">I.W.</abbr> <abbr title="Somerset">Som.</abbr>), confusion,
disorder, e.g. Go home hon a will, ’tis always the same, all
to a midge-madge, and her away neighbourin’; <em>miff-maff</em>
(<abbr title="north Country">n.Cy.</abbr> <abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr> <abbr title="Lancashire">Lan.</abbr>), nonsense, foolishness; <em>mingle-mangle</em> (<abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr>
<abbr title="Lancashire">Lan.</abbr> <abbr title="Leicestershire">Lei.</abbr> <abbr title="Northamptonshire">Nhp.</abbr>), a medley, a confused mixture, <abbr title="compare">cp.</abbr> ‘<em><span lang="frm" xml:lang="frm">Centon</span></em>,

<abbr title="Somerset">Som.</abbr> <abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr> <abbr title="Cornwall">Cor.</abbr>), crooked, ill-balanced, unsteady, e.g. I
knowed well enough that loäd ŏŏd never raich wham, it wuz
all wee-wow afore it lef’ the fild. As a noun it is common in
the phrase: all of a wee-wow. It can also signify squinting,
e.g. ’Er babby’s eyes is drefful wee-wow-like. Dr. Johnson
exhibits some contempt for this type of word, as for example:
‘Twittletwattle. <abbr title="noun substantive">n.s.</abbr> [A ludicrous reduplication of <em>twattle</em>.]
Tattle, gabble. A vile word.’ <abbr title="Compare">Cp.</abbr> <em>Twattle</em> (<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr>), foolish

<p class="new_para">It is very common to find two verbs of similar meaning
coupled together by <em>and</em>, as for instance: to <em>blare and blore</em>,

<abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr> <abbr title="Herefordshire">Hrf.</abbr> <abbr title="East Anglia">e.An.</abbr>) has the same meaning, but can also bear
the sense of to destroy property, waste. Dr. Johnson has:
‘To Rap <em>and rend</em> [more properly <em>rap and ran</em> ...] To seize
by violence,’ exemplified by a quotation from Butler’s
<cite>Hudibras</cite>. To <em>rug and rive</em> (<abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr> <abbr title="north Country">n.Cy.</abbr>) is to pull and tear, to
drag forcibly. A Northumbrian proverbial saying is: Like
the butter of Halterburn, it would neither rug nor rive, nor cut
with a knife—it was confounded. To <em>screw and scruple</em> (<abbr title="Berkshire">Brks.</abbr>)
is to beat down in price; to <em>steven and stoor</em> (<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr>) of the

matters which do not concern one—the phrase is generally
used in the negative, as in the old Berkshire proverb: Quoth

<span class="sub_head">PHONOLOGY AND GRAMMAR</span></h2>

<p class="new_para">The average educated Englishman has no accurate conception
of what a dialect really is, beyond a vague notion
that the term covers a mass of barbarisms, corruptions, and
mispronunciations of the King’s English, devoid of any order
or system, and used by the illiterate rustic in a haphazard
fashion with no regard to consistency. But as we have
already seen in Chapter VII, in very many cases it is the
standard language which contains the anomalies and the
corruptions, whilst the correct forms have been handed
down in the dialects where systematic sound-laws and exact
grammatical rules have been regularly developed and carried
out unhampered by the arbitrary rules of fashion, or the
regulations of a stereotyped spelling 400 years behind
the pronunciation. As Max Müller puts it: ‘the real and
natural life of language is in its dialects,’ <cite>The Science of
Language</cite>, <abbr title="volume 1, page 55">vol. i, p. 55.</abbr></p>

<p class="new_para">A dialect may be defined as one of the subordinate forms
or varieties of a language arising from local peculiarities of
pronunciation, vocabulary, and idiom, or as that form or
idiom of a language peculiar to a limited region or people, as
distinguished from the literary language of the whole people.
Hitherto we have been concerned chiefly with the second of
these three characteristics of a dialect, namely vocabulary,
but we will now consider in some detail the first on the list,
namely pronunciation, and here we cannot fail to be struck
by the wonderful uniformity and regularity of the sound-system
of modern dialects.</p>

<p class="new_para">To classify the modern dialects of a country is a difficult
and unsatisfactory task. If we possessed about three hundred
detailed grammars of the principal English dialects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
spoken in the United Kingdom, and could find hundreds of
competent people willing to answer queries about difficult or
doubtful points, it might be possible to furnish a classification
which would be tolerably accurate. But this is a state of
things never likely to be realized. Though a great deal
has been done in collecting material, it is as yet insufficient
to enable any one to give the exact geographical area over
which many of the grammatical phenomena extend, hence
the boundaries given in the classification of our dialects are
more or less roughly drawn. For all practical purposes we
may divide the English dialects into the following seven
groups:</p>

Phonology
</div>

<p class="new_para">The above are the main distinguishing features of the
phonology of the dialects as taken in groups, but no such list
can adequately represent the range of pronunciation in the
dialects taken individually. The extent of this range can
be shown by taking a list of common standard English
words, where the number of different ways in which they
are known to be pronounced in the various dialects has been
carefully counted and registered, e.g. all (20), both (27),
chamber (23), close (33), clothes (29), coat (20), cold (31),
cow (20), cucumber (35), daughter (36), do (17), done (24),
earth (44), father (35), gate (30), good (21), have (24), hold
(37), home (44), house (29), night (22), oats (30), old (42),
one (21), potato (46), so (24), through (29), whole (33),
wrong (22).</p>

<p class="new_para">The evidence of the pronunciation of words in the different
English dialects is of great importance to the student of
English philology, as he is thereby often enabled to explain
anomalies in the standard language. To take only one
instance: philologists have been at a loss to explain why
the word <em>oven</em> in <abbr title="literary English">lit. Eng.</abbr> does not rhyme with <em>cloven</em>. The
<abbr title="Old English">O.E.</abbr> recorded form is <em><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">ofen</span></em> parallel to the past participle
<em><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">clofen</span></em>, yet while the latter word has followed the normal
development, the former has the development not of an
original <abbr title="Old English">O.E.</abbr> <em><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">o</span></em>, but of <em><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">u</span></em>. Now the collected evidence of
the dialects goes to show that there must have been beside
the recorded <abbr title="Old English">O.E.</abbr> <em><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">ofen</span></em> an unrecorded form *<em><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">ufen</span></em> from which
<abbr title="literary English">lit. Eng.</abbr> <em>oven</em> is quite regularly developed, for the <em>o</em> representing
an older <em>u</em> is no more than the old French spelling
with which we are familiar in such words as <em>love</em>, <em>come</em>,
<em>son</em>, <abbr class="silent" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr></p>

<p class="new_para">We can best compare the phonology of the dialects with
that of the standard language by examining the vowels and

<p class="new_para"><span class="small_caps">Consonants.</span>—(1) The Semi-vowels. (<em>a</em>) <em>w.</em> Initial <em>w</em> has
generally remained before vowels, but in parts of <abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr> <abbr title="Midlands">Midl.</abbr>
<abbr title="East Anglia">e.An.</abbr> and <abbr title="south-west Country">sw.Cy.</abbr> it has disappeared in certain words,
mainly where it stands before a following <em>u</em>, such as <em>woman</em>,
<em>wonder</em>, <em>wood</em>, <em>wool</em>, <em>wound</em>, <abbr class="silent" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> There are no examples in
the dialects of initial <em>w</em> being changed to <em>v</em> before a following
vowel. This sound-change, characteristic of the language
spoken by Mr. Samuel Weller and his father—‘ven’, ‘vay’,
‘svear’, ‘anyveres’, <abbr class="silent" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>—seems to have been invented by
Dickens. The converse, namely, the change of initial <em>v</em> to
<em>w</em>, does occur in <abbr title="Buckinghamshire">Bck.</abbr> <abbr title="Norfolk">Nrf.</abbr> <abbr title="Suffolk">Suf.</abbr> <abbr title="Essex">Ess.</abbr> <abbr title="Kent">Ken.</abbr> <abbr title="east Sussex">e.Sus.</abbr>, and Dickens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
would have heard this pronunciation—<em>wery</em>, very, <em>wenter</em>,
venture—used by the class of person typified in Sam Weller,
but there is no authority for the change of <em>w</em> to <em>v</em>, and it can
only be described as ‘artist’s licence’. An initial <em>w</em> has
often arisen in the dialects through a falling diphthong
having become a rising diphthong, e.g. in such words as
<em>wome</em>, <em>wum</em>, <em>woats</em>, <em>wold</em>, <abbr title="literary English">lit. Eng.</abbr> <em>home</em>, <em>oats</em>, <em>old</em>. This
accounts for the <em>w</em> in the place-names Woking, Wokingham,
which within living memory were pronounced Oaking,
Oakingham, and for the pronunciation of <abbr title="literary English">lit. Eng.</abbr> <em>one</em>, <em>once</em>,
and the spelling <em>whole</em>. Initial <em>hw</em> has become <em>f</em> in <abbr title="north-east Scotland">ne.Sc.</abbr> in
such words as <em>what</em>, <em>wheat</em>, <em>wheel</em>, <abbr class="silent" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> Initial <em>kw</em> has often
become <em>tw</em> in <abbr title="north Country">n.Cy.</abbr> dialects, in such words as <em>twilt</em>, <abbr title="literary English">lit. Eng.</abbr>
<em>quilt</em>. A <em>w</em> has often been developed before a back vowel
preceded by a consonant, especially a labial, more rarely
when preceded by a guttural, dental, nasal, or liquid. This
<em>w</em> is chiefly confined to the <abbr title="south Midlands, south and south-west">s.Midl. s. and sw.</abbr> dialects when
the preceding consonant is a labial, as <em>bwone</em>, <em>bwoy</em>, <em>pwoizn</em>,
<abbr title="literary English">lit. Eng.</abbr> <em>bone</em>, <em>boy</em>, <em>poison</em>. Medial <em>w</em> has generally disappeared
in words compounded with <em>-ward</em>, <em>-worth</em>, as <em>awkward</em>,
<em>backward</em>, <em>pennyworth</em>, <abbr class="silent" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> It has also generally disappeared
in <em>always</em>, and in <em>somewhat</em>.</p>

<p class="new_para">(<em>b</em>) <em>j.</em> This consonant is represented in modern English
spelling by <em>y</em>. An initial <em>j</em> has often arisen in the dialects

as <em><span lang="fonipa" xml:lang="fonipa">jabl</span></em>, <em><span lang="fonipa" xml:lang="fonipa">jek</span></em>, <em><span lang="fonipa" xml:lang="fonipa">jiər</span></em>, <abbr title="literary English">lit. Eng.</abbr> <em>able</em>, <em>ache</em>, <em>ear</em>. Many educated
people in the south of England make no difference
in the pronunciation of <em>ear</em> and <em>year</em>. A <abbr title="south Midlands">s.Midl.</abbr> <abbr title="south Country">s.Cy.</abbr> saying
to express a long period of time is ‘years and years and
donkey’s ears’. A medial <em>j</em> has often been developed after
a consonant. In many cases the change has been caused
by a falling diphthong having become a rising diphthong, e.g.
<em><span lang="fonipa" xml:lang="fonipa">gjārdin</span></em>, <em><span lang="fonipa" xml:lang="fonipa">kjetl</span></em>, <abbr title="literary English">lit. Eng.</abbr> <em>garden</em>, <em>kettle</em>.</p>

<p class="new_para">(2) The Liquids. (<em>a</em>) <em>l.</em> Medial <em>l</em> has often disappeared,

parts of n.<abbr title="Durham">Dur.</abbr> it is a uvular <em>r</em>, not unlike the French <em>r</em>. It
is often called ‘the Northumberland burr’. In all the
<abbr title="south and south-west">s. and sw.</abbr> dialects it is a reverted or retracted <em>r</em>, the trill being
indistinct and less sharp than for the <abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr> <em>r</em>. Similarly in
these dialects the <em>l</em> is reverted. In the rest of England <em>r</em> has
had practically the same development as in the standard
language. When a word ends in and the next word begins
with a vowel, a ‘euphonic’ <em>r</em> is generally inserted to avoid
a hiatus, in the <abbr title="south Midlands">s.Midl.</abbr>, eastern, southern, and south-western
dialects, as <em><span lang="fonipa" xml:lang="fonipa">aidiər əv it</span></em>, idea of it, <em><span lang="fonipa" xml:lang="fonipa">Sērər An</span></em>, Sarah Ann, <em><span lang="fonipa" xml:lang="fonipa">lǭr
əv Iŋglənd</span></em>, law of England. And an <em>r</em> is sometimes inserted
medially, as <em><span lang="fonipa" xml:lang="fonipa">drǭrin</span></em>, drawing. This insertion of ‘euphonic’
<em>r</em> is not confined to dialect speakers, it is quite common
among educated people in the <abbr title="south Midlands">s.Midl.</abbr> and <abbr title="southern">s.</abbr> counties, and
seems to be spreading gradually further north. <em>r</em> has often
undergone metathesis, especially in the <abbr title="south-west">sw.</abbr> dialects in <em><span lang="fonipa" xml:lang="fonipa">apə̄n</span></em>,
<em><span lang="fonipa" xml:lang="fonipa">tʃildən</span></em>, <em><span lang="fonipa" xml:lang="fonipa">gərn</span></em>, <em><span lang="fonipa" xml:lang="fonipa">h)undəd</span></em>, <em><span lang="fonipa" xml:lang="fonipa">pə̄ti</span></em>, <abbr class="silent" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, <abbr title="literary English">lit.

in <abbr title="Old English">O.E.</abbr> The <em>t</em> in French words which has become <em><span lang="fonipa" xml:lang="fonipa">tʃ</span></em> [the
sound of the medial consonant in <em>nature</em>] in <abbr title="literary English">lit. Eng.</abbr> through
the influence of the following <em><span lang="fonipa" xml:lang="fonipa">ü</span></em> has remained unchanged in
the dialects, as <em><span lang="fonipa" xml:lang="fonipa">piktə(r</span></em>, picture, <em><span lang="fonipa" xml:lang="fonipa">fiətə(r</span></em>, feature. Final <em>t</em> has
disappeared in many dialects after voiceless consonants,
especially in the combination <em>st</em>; finally after <em>k</em> and <em>p</em> it has
disappeared in all <abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr> dialects, as <em>fak(t</em>, <em>korek(t</em>, <em>temp(t</em>.
Examples of the loss of <em>t</em> after <em>s</em> occur in all parts of <abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr> <abbr title="Ireland">Irel.</abbr>

in all dialects except those of the <abbr title="east and south-east">e. and se.</abbr> counties
to become <em>t</em> in words of more than one syllable, especially
after <em>n</em> and <em>r</em>, as <em>bi-jont</em>, beyond, <abbr class="silent" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> Final <em>d</em> has generally
disappeared after <em>n</em> in <abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr>, but in the southern counties of <abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr>
it has only disappeared in the conjunction <em>and</em>, the present
participles, and in the <abbr title="preterite and past participle">pret. and pp.</abbr> of strong verbs whose
present ends in <em>-nd</em>. This loss of final <em>d</em> in the <abbr title="preterite and past participle">pret. and pp.</abbr>

<em><span lang="fonipa" xml:lang="fonipa">ðə</span></em>. In those dialects which have both <em><span lang="fonipa" xml:lang="fonipa">t</span></em> and <em><span lang="fonipa" xml:lang="fonipa">þ</span></em>, the former is
used before consonants (<em><span lang="fonipa" xml:lang="fonipa">tman</span></em>, <abbr class="silent" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>), and the latter before
vowels (<em><span lang="fonipa" xml:lang="fonipa">þapl</span></em>, <abbr class="silent" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>), and when the sentence begins with the
definite article.</p>

<p class="new_para">(6) The Sibilants. <em>s.</em> Initial voiceless <em>s</em> has become <em>z</em> in
those dialects where <em>f</em> in the same position has become <em>v</em>,
<abbr title="compare">cp.</abbr> (4)(<em>c</em>) above. There is in the dialects a large number of
words beginning with <em>s</em> plus a consonant where in most cases
the <em>s</em> is not original. It occurs most frequently in the combinations
<em>sk</em> and <em>sq</em>. In fact nearly all the <em>sq</em> words occurring
in the dialects have forms with and without initial <em>s</em>. No
rule can be laid down about the geographical distribution of
the words belonging to this category. Examples are: <em>sclasp</em>
beside <em>clasp</em>, <em>sclimb</em> beside <em>climb</em>, <em>scrawl</em> beside <em>crawl</em>, <em>scroodle</em>
beside <em>croodle</em>, to crouch, <em>skist</em> beside <em>kist</em>, a chest, <em>snotch</em>

<abbr class="silent" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, <abbr class="silent" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> Dr. Johnson was familiar with <em>scraunch</em> beside
<em>craunch</em>, <abbr title="compare">cp.</abbr> ‘To Craunch. <abbr title="verb active">v.a.</abbr> [<em><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">schrantsen</span></em>, Dutch; whence

as <em>aps</em>, asp, <em>klaps</em>, clasp, <em>lipsy</em>, to lisp; <em>wæps</em> and <em>wæsp</em>
existed in <abbr title="Old English">O.E.</abbr>, so in the modern dialects there are double
forms.</p>

<p class="new_para">(7) The Gutturals. (<em>a</em>) <em>k.</em> Initial <em>k</em>, generally written <em>c</em> in
<abbr title="Old English">O.E.</abbr>, has remained before <em>n</em> in such words as <em>knave</em>, <em>knead</em>,
<em>knit</em>, <em>knock</em>, <abbr class="silent" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, in <abbr title="north-east Scotland">ne.Sc.</abbr> In the remaining parts of
Scotland it has disappeared in the dialect of the younger
generation. In the early part of the last century it was
preserved in all <abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr> dialects. <em>tn</em> from older <em>kn</em> is still used
by old people in <abbr title="west Forfarshire">w.Frf.</abbr> and <abbr title="east Perthshire">e.Per.</abbr> A generation ago this
<em>tn</em> was also common in the dialects of <abbr title="Cumberland">Cum.</abbr> and <abbr title="Westmorland">Wm.</abbr>, but it
is now obsolete. Initial <em>cl</em> has become <em>tl</em> in many of the
dialects of <abbr title="England">Eng.</abbr> especially in <abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr> <abbr title="Lancashire">Lan.</abbr> the Midlands, and
the <abbr title="south and south-west">s. and sw.</abbr> dialects, in such words as <em>clap</em>, <em>claw</em>, <em>cliff</em>,
<em>climb</em>, <em>cloak</em>, <em>cloud</em>. No <abbr title="Scottish">Sc.</abbr> or <abbr title="Irish">Ir.</abbr> dialect has changed initial
<em>cl</em> to <em>tl</em>. In other respects initial <em>c</em> has generally had the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
same development in the dialects as in the standard language.
Initial <em>sc</em> has become, <span lang="fonipa" xml:lang="fonipa">ʃ</span> [the initial sound in <em>she</em>] in
native <abbr title="English">Eng.</abbr> words just as in the <abbr title="literary">lit.</abbr> language, as <em>shade</em>, <em>shell</em>,

in the dialects just as in the <abbr title="literary">lit.</abbr> language, as <em>scaffold</em>, <em>scale</em>,
<em>scatter</em>, <em>school</em>, <em>skin</em>, <abbr class="silent" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> Excluding all <em>sc-</em> words which are

language and the dialects—such as the words in the above
list: <em>scaffold</em>, <em>scale</em>, <abbr class="silent" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>—it is a remarkable fact that the
<cite>English Dialect Dictionary</cite> contains no less than 1,154
simple <em>sc-</em> words. This points to one of two things: either
the dialects contain a far larger number of Norse words than
is generally supposed, or else it is not certain that initial <em>sc</em>
has under all circumstances become ʃ in native words in
the dialects. Words where a final <em>k</em> has become <em><span lang="fonipa" xml:lang="fonipa">tʃ</span></em> in the
<abbr title="literary language">lit. lang.</abbr> generally have <em><span lang="fonipa" xml:lang="fonipa">tʃ</span></em> also in the dialects, as <em>bleach</em>, <em>flitch</em>,

parts of the <abbr title="north Midlands">n.Midlands</abbr> assibilation has not taken place to
the same extent as in the <abbr title="literary">lit.</abbr> language, hence such forms as

<p class="new_para">A. The Indefinite Article. Very few dialects follow the
rule of the literary language according to which <em>an</em> is used
before a vowel or <em>h</em> mute. <em><span lang="fonipa" xml:lang="fonipa">ə</span></em> is used before vowels and consonants,
as <em><span lang="fonipa" xml:lang="fonipa">ə apl</span></em>, an apple. When <em>n</em> is used it is generally
attached to the noun, as <em><span lang="fonipa" xml:lang="fonipa">ə napl</span></em>. In all the dialects of <abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr>
<abbr title="Ireland">Irel.</abbr> and <abbr title="England">Eng.</abbr> the indefinite article is used redundantly
before numerals and nouns of multitude and quantity, as:
more than a twenty of them; a many; a plenty; <abbr title="compare">cp.</abbr> <abbr title="literary English">lit. Eng.</abbr>
a few. This construction occurs in our older literature,
<abbr title="compare">cp.</abbr> ‘<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">A many fools</span>,’ <cite><abbr title="The Merchant of Venice">Mer. of Venice</abbr></cite>, <abbr title="Act 3 scene 5 line 73"><span class="act">III.</span> v. 73</abbr>.</p>

<p class="new_para">B. The Definite Article. The dialect forms of the definite
article have been given above under the consonant <em><span lang="fonipa" xml:lang="fonipa">þ</span></em>. In
those dialects where the form is <em>t</em>, should the following word
begin with a dental, the only trace of the article is the suspension
of the dental. A clear distinction is made between
<em><span lang="fonipa" xml:lang="fonipa">teəbl</span></em>, table, and <em><span lang="fonipa" xml:lang="fonipa">t’eəbl</span></em>, the table, <em><span lang="fonipa" xml:lang="fonipa">dlium</span></em>, gloom, and <em><span lang="fonipa" xml:lang="fonipa">d’lium</span></em>,
the gloom. These same dialects, owing to liturgical influence,
use the full form <em><span lang="fonipa" xml:lang="fonipa">ðə</span></em> before <em><span lang="fonipa" xml:lang="fonipa">loəd</span></em>, Lord, when applied to the
Deity, save in off-hand speech and in the phrase <em><span lang="fonipa" xml:lang="fonipa">loəd nǭz</span></em>, the
Lord knows, where the article is omitted altogether. The
ending of the <abbr title="Old English">O.E.</abbr> neuter form of the definite article survives
in <em><span lang="fonipa" xml:lang="fonipa">tōn</span></em>, the one (<abbr title="Old English">O.E.</abbr> <em><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">ðæt ān</span></em>), and <em><span lang="fonipa" xml:lang="fonipa">tuðə(r</span>, <span lang="fonipa" xml:lang="fonipa">tɒðə(r</span></em>, the other
(<abbr title="Old English">O.E.</abbr> <em><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">ðæt ōðer</span></em>). These words are in general use in the
dialects of <abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr> <abbr title="Ireland">Irel.</abbr> and <abbr title="England">Eng.</abbr>; their origin being forgotten,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
the ordinary form of the definite article is often used redundantly
before them.</p>

Accidence: Pronouns
</div>

<p class="new_para">In all the dialects of <abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr> and <abbr title="England">Eng.</abbr> there is a tendency to
introduce a redundant personal pronoun after a noun when
emphasis is required; this is especially frequent after
a proper name, as: Mr. Smith, he came to my house. In
<abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr> and the northern dialects a pronoun is often used to
introduce a statement, the specific subject being added later,
as: it runs very well, does that horse. In all the dialects
of <abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr> and <abbr title="England">Eng.</abbr> the objective form of the personal pronoun
is used for the nominative: (1) After the substantive verb,
as: it was her that did it. (2) When standing alone, as:
Who did that? Her. (3) When the verb refers to different
persons, as: him and me did it; Jack and us went together.
(4) When antecedent to a relative pronoun, and therefore
separated from its verb by a subordinate sentence, as: him
that did that ought to be hanged. The objective forms are
often used for the nominative when the pronouns are unemphatic,
especially in the south-midland, eastern, southern,
and south-western counties. Conversely in all the dialects
of these same counties the nominative of the personal pronoun
is used as the emphatic form of the objective case, as:
her did it; her saw she. In <abbr title="Ireland">Irel.</abbr> the impersonal phrase <em>it is</em>
often occurs redundantly at the beginning of a sentence, as:
it’s sorry you will be; it’s sleepy I am.</p>

<p class="new_para">The various dialect forms of the personal pronouns are of
special interest to the philologist in that they supply living
examples to prove the truth of the theory necessary to
explain the original forms of the pronouns in the separate
branches of the Indo-Germanic family of languages. Most
of the pronouns, especially the personal and demonstrative,
must have had accented and unaccented forms existing side
by side in the parent language itself, and then one or other
of the forms became generalized already in the prehistoric
period of the individual branches of the parent language.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
At a later period, but still in prehistoric times, there arose
new accented and unaccented forms side by side in the individual
branches, as e.g. in <abbr title="primitive">prim.</abbr> Germanic <em><span lang="gem" xml:lang="gem">ek</span></em>, <em><span lang="gem" xml:lang="gem">mek</span></em> beside
<em><span lang="gem" xml:lang="gem">ik</span></em>, <em><span lang="gem" xml:lang="gem">mik</span></em>. The separate Germanic languages generalized one
or other of these forms before the beginning of the oldest
literary monuments, and then new accented beside unaccented
forms came into existence again. And similarly
during the historic periods of the different languages. Thus,
e.g., the <abbr title="Old English">O.E.</abbr> for <em>I</em> is <em><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">ic</span></em>; this became in <abbr title="Middle English">M.E.</abbr> <em><span lang="enm" xml:lang="enm">ich</span></em> accented form
beside <em><span lang="enm" xml:lang="enm">i</span></em> unaccented form; <em><span lang="enm" xml:lang="enm">ich</span></em> then disappeared in standard
<abbr title="Middle English">M.E.</abbr> (but it is still preserved in one of the modern dialects
of Somersetshire), and <em><span lang="enm" xml:lang="enm">i</span></em> came to be used as the accented and
unaccented form. At a later period it became <em><span lang="enm" xml:lang="enm">ī</span></em> when accented
and remained <em><span lang="enm" xml:lang="enm">i</span></em> when unaccented. The former has
become <abbr title="literary English">lit. Eng.</abbr> <em>I</em>, and the latter has disappeared from the
<abbr title="literary">lit.</abbr> language, but it is still preserved in many northern <abbr title="English">Eng.</abbr>
dialects as <em><span lang="fonipa" xml:lang="fonipa">i</span></em>. In these dialects <em><span lang="fonipa" xml:lang="fonipa">i</span></em> is regularly used in interrogative
and subordinate sentences; the <abbr title="Middle English">M.E.</abbr> accented form
<em><span lang="enm" xml:lang="enm">ī</span></em> has become <em><span lang="fonipa" xml:lang="fonipa">ai</span></em> and is only used in the dialects to express
special emphasis, and from it a new unaccented form <em><span lang="fonipa" xml:lang="fonipa">a</span></em> has
been developed, which can only be used in making direct
assertions. Thus in one and the same dialect (Windhill,
<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr>) we arrive at three forms: <em><span lang="fonipa" xml:lang="fonipa">ai</span></em>, <em><span lang="fonipa" xml:lang="fonipa">a</span></em>, <em><span lang="fonipa" xml:lang="fonipa">i</span></em>, which are never
mixed up syntactically by genuine native dialect speakers.
Something similar to what has happened and is still happening
in the modern dialects must also have taken place in the
prehistoric and historic periods of all the Indo-Germanic
languages.</p>

<p class="new_para">Preterites. In the conjugation of verbs in the dialects
many old forms have been preserved which have been lost
in the literary language. Very often where, in the <abbr title="literary">lit.</abbr> language,
the old plural form of the preterite or the past participle
has been carried through the whole preterite, in the
dialects the old singular form has been levelled out. Or
again, an old strong verb has in <abbr title="literary English">lit. Eng.</abbr> become weak, whilst
in the dialects the strong forms have remained. On the
whole, it is the northern dialects which have preserved these
old strong preterite forms. It may be said to be characteristic
of the southern dialects to form new weak preterites to
originally strong verbs. Examples of verbs which have
preserved old strong preterites are: bind, <em><span lang="fonipa" xml:lang="fonipa">ban(d</span></em> (<abbr title="Old English">O.E.</abbr> <em><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">band</span></em>),

Midland, <abbr title="east Country"><abbr title="east Country">e.Cy.</abbr></abbr> and <abbr title="south-west Country">sw.Cy.</abbr> dialects, as: <em>I am a-goin</em>. This
is an interesting point when we realize that it proves the
origin of our present participle ending <em>ing</em>, which cannot be
developed from the <abbr title="Old English">O.E.</abbr> <em><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">ende</span></em>. The form with the prefix
<em><span lang="fonipa" xml:lang="fonipa">ə</span></em> represents the verbal noun (<abbr title="Old English">O.E.</abbr> <em><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">-ung</span></em>, <em><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">-ing</span></em>) preceded by
the preposition <em><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">on</span></em>. The preposition dwindled through lack
of stress into a mere prefix, and was ultimately lost in

<span class="sub_head">POPULAR PHRASES AND SAYINGS</span></h2>

<p class="new_para">To most people the details contained in the preceding
chapter will seem but the dry bones of dialect speech; they
would prefer the bones to be covered with sinews and flesh.
Dialect speech as the embodiment of living, many-sided,
human nature is perhaps nowhere so closely seen as in a collection
of the figurative terms and phrases applied to people
and things. Here we approach the unlimited humour
displayed in the dialects. It is of all kinds—the ironical, the
sage, the frankly jolly, the merely ridiculous. It takes
every shape; we meet it in similes, metaphors, proverbs, and
in various other forms which elude description. A characteristic
form of humour, often combined with sarcasm,
appears in those comparisons wherein the moods, habits, and
actions of men are likened to those of birds, beasts, fishes,
and even insects in real or imaginary situations. The following
is a miscellaneous selection of similes: as awkward as
a cat in pattens; as big as bull-beef, said of a conceited
person; as black as the devil’s nutting-bag; as blue as
a whetstone; as bug [self-satisfied, vain] as a pump with
two spouts; as busy as bees in a basin, said when any one
is busy about trifles; as busy as a cat in a tripe-shop; as
clean as print; as cold as snow in harvest, said of any one
who looks hard and unfeeling; as dark as a boot; as dark
as a black cow’s skin, said of a very dark night; as dateless
as a rubbin’-stoop [as stupid, insensible as a rubbing-post];
as dazed as a duck against thunder; as dazed as a goose
with a nail in its head; as deaf as a beetle [a wooden mallet];
as deaf as a haddock; as drunk as mice, <abbr title="compare">cp.</abbr> ‘<span lang="enm" xml:lang="enm">We faren as he

refers to the pedlar’s staff which supports the pack on his
back, and also serves to measure his wares, and which by
constant wear on his journeyings becomes exceedingly
smooth. The better known version—as plain as a pike-staff—is
thought to be a corruption of pack-staff. As peart as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>

Similes and Metaphors
</div>

<p class="new_para">To look like a bit of chewed twine is to look worn out; the
tears were running down his cheeks like beetles up a hill is
said in ridicule of a child who is crying for nothing; to grin
like a Cheshire cat chewing gravel, eating cheese, or brass wire.
Charles Lamb once explained why a Cheshire cat is given to
grinning: ‘I made a pun the other day, and palmed it upon
Holcroft, who grinned like a Cheshire cat. (Why do cats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
grin in Cheshire?—Because it was once a county palatine,
and the cats cannot help laughing whenever they think of it,
though I see no great joke in it.)’ <em>Letters</em>, <abbr title="volume 1, page 245">vol. i, p. 245</abbr>.
Like a chip in a mess of milk, or like a chip in porridge, said
of a person or thing of no importance, useless; to stare like
a choked throstle, or like a throttled earwig; like a cow
handling a musket, said of a person doing something in
a clumsy manner; to look like death on a mopstick is to
look miserable; to work like Diggory is to work hard.
The name Diggory was once a common Christian name. It
occurs as the name of a farm labourer in Goldsmith’s <cite>She
Stoops to Conquer</cite>. To go like a dinner of broth is to go
successfully without hitch or friction; short and sweet like
a donkey’s gallop; to go buzzing away like a dumbley-dory
[a bumble-bee] in a snoxun [a foxglove], or like a dumble-dore
in a warming-pan, is said of a humdrum preacher; she’s
like an old ewe dressed lamb-fashion is said of an old woman
gaily dressed; she’s in and out of folkses housen like a
fiddler’s elbow is said of a gossiping woman; to be like a fly
in a glue-pot is to be in a state of nervous excitement; to
have a memory like a frog-tail is to have a bad memory, or
none at all; to be like a hen on a hot girdle is to be restless
and impatient; off, like a jug handle; laid out like lamb and
sallet is said of a person gaily dressed; it’s bare work and
poor pay, like licking honey off a thorn, said of an employment
yielding only a small and uncertain profit; lost like
a lop in a barn, said of a person living in too big a house;
to be like a pig in a well is to be without visible means of
support; to be like a pig, to do no good alive, is said of
a covetous and selfish man; it’s much cry for little wool,
like shearing a pig; to mend like sour ale in summer is
to grow worse and worse; to look like a sow with side-pockets
is said of a person absurdly dressed; anything very
useless is said to be of no more use than a side-pocket is to
a toad, or an umbrella to a duck; like a sucking duck, said
of a foolish person; it’s slow work, like sucking buttermilk
out of a sieve; to follow any one like a Tantony pig is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>

one who has a very uncertain seat on horseback, and also of
a person in a very uncertain condition of affairs; like
a toad out of a tree—thump; to live or lead a life like a toad
under a harrow is to suffer from ill-treatment or ill-usage;
he’s like a Tom-noup [the great tit] on a round of beef, said
of a swaggering, pretentious, little man; drinking to drown
sorrow is like trying to sleck a fire with gunpowder; it runs

Conversational Allusions to Fictitious Persons or Things
</div>

<p class="new_para">Beside these are the longer similes in the style of those
conversational allusions for which Sam Weller is famous.
For example: all asiden like Martha Roden’s twopenny dish,
said of something aslant, out of the perpendicular; like the
old cow’s tail, all behind, said when any one is behind-hand
with work; all to one side like the handle of a jug;
same’s the crow said by the heap of toads, all of a sort;
same’s the old Tucker found his halfpenny, all to a heap;
all together like Brown’s cows; like Morley’s ducks, born
without a notion; it’s as broad as it’s long, like Paddy’s
blanket, means that it matters not which of two ways a thing
is done; clean gone, like the boy’s eye, and that went into
his head; like Malachi’s child, choke-full of sense, said of
any one who boasts of himself or of his children; to do
things by degrees as the cat ate the pestle [shank or foreleg
of an animal, especially of a pig]; as dirty as Thump-o’-Dolly,
that died of being washed; dressed to death like
Sally Hatch; forty save one like Obitch’s colt, applied to
persons of a certain age who affect youthful manners; he’s
like a pig-tail, going all day and nothing done at night; he’s
like the parson’s fool, he likes everything that’s good; like
Jan Trezise’s geese, never happy unless they be where they
baint; hitty-missy, as the blind man shot the crow;
nought’s impossible, as the old woman said when they told
her the calf had swallowed the grindlestone; knoppy road,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
as the man said when he stumbled over a cow; as knowing
as Kate Mullet, and she was hanged for a fool; you’re late,
as Paddy Loughran said to the ghost; as lazy as Ludlam’s
dog, that leaned up against the wall to bark; long in the legs
like Nanny Panter’s hens; like lucky Jan Toy, who lost
a shilling and found a twopenny loaf, applied to any one who
is rejoicing over a small gain purchased at the expense of
a greater loss; there’s more clout than pie, as the schoolboy
said when he unwrapped his dinner; he won’t do it if he
hasn’t a mind to, as the man said by his jackass; ’tis neat
but not gaudy, as they said of the devil when they painted
his body pea-green, and tied up his tail with red ribbons,
said in ridicule of showy dress; don’t be in a hurry, it’s one
at a time here, as the old woman said at the wirligog [turn-stile];
as queer as Dick’s hatband, that went nine times
round and would not tie at last; like the quest [wood-pigeon]
always saying ‘to do’, but everybody knows it makes the
worst nest in the wood; thee beest a queer quest, as the
boy said to the owl; quietness is best, as the fox said when
he bit the cock’s head off; as throng as Throp’s wife when
she hanged herself with the dish-clout, applied to a woman
who is for ever busying herself about domestic affairs, but
whose house and surroundings are nevertheless always
untidy; you thought wrong, like Hob’s hog, which, it is
said, when the butcher went into the sty to kill it, fancied
its breakfast was coming. To catch a person napping, as
Moss caught his mare, is a saying which occurs as far back
as 1641 in Taylor’s works. To sit like Mumchancer who was
hanged for saying nothing contains an allusion to an old
game of chance played with cards or dice, at which silence
was essential.</p>

<p class="new_para">An interesting elucidation of the common proverb: Don’t
spoil your ship for a ha’porth of tar, is given by comparison
with the dialect version of it, which remains faithful to the
original. The saying Dunnot loaz t’yow [ewe] for a hawporth
o’ tar, i.e. do not be niggardly or over-economical in farming,
is recorded as far back as 1636 in the form ‘<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">hee that will
loose a sheepe (or a hogge) for a pennyworth of tarre cannot
deserve the name of a good husband</span>’. It thus becomes
clear that our word ‘ship’ is here a dialect form of sheep,
and that the ha’porth of tar does not signify the remedy for
a leaking vessel, for which it would be wholly inadequate,
but the means for marking the owner’s initial on a sheep’s
back to prevent its being unrecognized when found straying.
The introduction of spoil for lose is no doubt due to the
misunderstanding of ‘ship’.</p>

day nettles; he’s gone deeod sure enough, an’ iv he’s ta’en
his brass wi’ him it’ll be melted bi neaw; thou’l niver be
satisfied til thoo gets thi moothful a mould is a phrase used
to a grumbling, discontented person; he’s nowt good for till
he’s happed up [buried, <abbr title="literally">lit.</abbr> covered], said of a miserly churl;
they’ve a-putt poar ol’ Bill tü beyd wi’ a showl [shovel] tüday;
of a delicate person not yet old, it is said he’ll never carry
a grey toppin’ whoam; of a person too ill to be likely to
recover it is said: I fear he’s boun’ up padjan-tree; the
sexton has shaked his shool at him; of an old man in failing
health it is said he’s going down the brewe [brow, hill]; it’s
welly [wellnigh] six o’clock with him, six o’clock being the
hour at which labourers, when it is light, leave off work;
he’s gettin’ into th’ linderins. The linderins or lindrins are
ropes put round a weaver’s beam when the woof is nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
finished, and the term is applied thus figuratively to the
approaching end of an old man’s life. And then, when the
end has come, like the hand-loom weaver whose work is
finished: he’s ta’en his reed and gears in at last. There is
something picturesque in the use of the phrase to go home
applied to trees and flowers. My gardener always speaks of
a dead plant or a withered blossom as having gone home.</p>

Salutations
</div>

<p class="new_para">Dialect forms of greeting are usually short and comprehensive.
It is not uncommon for a rustic to pass the time
of day with a friend met on the road by the use of a single
monosyllable. All forms of salutation, from the single
monosyllable to the interchange of a few remarks, may be
termed passing the time o’day. This expression is current
in practically all the dialects of England, e.g. A niver stopped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
to speak to ’im, on’y just passed the time o’ day, <abbr title="compare">cp.</abbr> ‘<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">But

<abbr title="Act 1 scene 1 line 122"><span class="act">I.</span> i. 122</abbr>. Noo! is a common greeting in the North when
two friends meet. There are various forms of inquiry after
the well-being of the person addressed, e.g. Well, an’ how be
’ee to-day? Purty bobbish, thank-ee. Are ye middlin’ weel?
Hoo’s a’ wi’ ye? On a grey day among the Yorkshire moors
every native one meets salutes one with the single word
Dull! If the weather be fine he will say in passing, Grand
day! If wet, his greeting will be: Soft weather! or, A soft
day! A story is told of two Irishmen who thus greeted
each other when they met at a Fair: Bad luck to you, Pat,
says one, How are you? Good luck to you! Mick, answered
the other, and may neither of them come true.</p>

<p class="new_para">A common Devonshire salutation at meal-times is Gude
stummick to ee wan an’ all, a phrase which from its like
significance might claim country-cousinship with the after-dinner
greeting ‘Gesegnete Mahlzeit’ of North Germany.
A Cornish grace before meat runs: Lord mek us able To
eat what’s upon table, followed by: The Lord be praised
Our stummicks be aised. Outspoken phrases of this kind
have their charm, when they proceed from simple, honest
hearts. After a long morning walk on a Yorkshire moor,
plates of home-made cake, and tumblers of new milk, spread
in a farm-house kitchen with the homely invitation, Reik
tul, an’ mak yersens at ’oam, can be a meal which will linger
in the memory long afterwards as a feast of fat things, and
wines on the lees well refined. Reach to, in its various
forms, is the ordinary phrase in the northern dialects,
e.g. Noo reeach teea an’ help yersels, ther’s nowt ya need be
neyce [shy] aboot, an’ ya needn’t mak spare ov owt; Noo,
deean’t be owre neyce, reach tul an’ git agait; Noo you

noa assing [await no asking]; I’s ower meeat-yabble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
[hungry] to be blate [bashful]. Not this time, thank you,
is a polite way of declining to take any more food at the
hospitable board, and when the guest leaves the house he
says: Well, a mun love ye, and leave ye.</p>

Phrases applied to Localities

<p class="new_para">Corresponding to the figurative and proverbial similes
and sayings of a general nature are the more strictly local
ones, recording some feature of the locality, some current
tradition, or some real or imaginary characteristic of the
inhabitants of a special town or county, for example: all on
one side like Bridgnorth Election, said of anything which is
oblique or out of the perpendicular. The saying is supposed
to refer to the fact that members of the Tory Whitmore
families of Apley, near Bridgnorth, have, with rare exceptions,
represented the borough in Parliament from 1663
onwards for over two hundred years. All on one side like
Marton Chapel (<abbr title="Cheshire">Chs.</abbr>); all on one side like Parkgate, said
of anything lopsided. Parkgate is a fishing village on the
Cheshire side of the river Dee, consisting of one long street
with houses on one side only, the sea wall being on the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
side. All play and no play, like Boscastle Market, which
begins at twelve o’clock and ends at noon (<abbr title="Cornwall">Cor.</abbr>); always
too late like Mobberly clock (<abbr title="Cheshire">Chs.</abbr>); to end in a whew, like
Cawthorne feast, said of anything which ends badly or
never comes to pass (<abbr title="west Yorkshire">w.Yks.</abbr>); like a Whillymer cheese, it
wants an axe and a saw to cut it (<abbr title="north Country">n.Cy.</abbr>); it’s gone over
Borough Hill after Jackson’s pig, said when anything is lost.
Borough Hill is an extensive Roman encampment near
Daventry. ’Tis as long in coming as Cotswold barley,
applied to things which are slow but sure. This proverb,
alluding to the slow growth and ultimate excellence of
Cotswold corn, is amongst those collected by Ray in 1678.
Ship-shape and Bristol fashion signifies respectability,
steadiness, stolidity; he has been sworn in at Highgate, is
said of a man who is very sharp or clever (<abbr title="north Derbyshire">n.Der.</abbr>). The
custom of swearing on the horns at Highgate near London is
described in Hone’s <cite>Everyday Book</cite>, 1827. As big as Russell’s
wagon (<abbr title="Cornwall">Cor.</abbr>). This was a huge wagon for the conveyance
of goods and passengers, drawn by six, eight, or even ten
horses. It took nearly a fortnight to go from Cornwall to
London. Passengers sometimes took their own bedding
with them, and slept in the wagon, and they made their wills
before starting. Like Nicholas Kemp he’s got occasion for
all (<abbr title="Cornwall">Cor.</abbr>) is a saying referring to a traditional voter in
a Cornish borough who, in order that it might not be said
that any one had given him a bribe, was told to help himself
from a table covered with gold in the election committee-room.
Taking off his hat, he swept the whole mass into it,
saying: ‘I’ve occasion for all.’ They’ll rax [stretch] an’ run
up like Tommy Yarrow’s breeches (<abbr title="Northumberland">Nhb.</abbr>) is applied to
anything very elastic. Tommy Yarrow was a celebrated
maker of leather breeches, which he asserted to be capable
of stretching or shrinking to meet the wearer’s requirements.
To <em>creg</em> means to be short-tempered or ill-natured, like the
inhabitants of Cragg Hill, a geographical portion of Horsforth

Phrases denoting Local Characteristics
</div>

<p class="new_para">To direct a person to go to a place not to be named to
ears polite is to tell him: to go to Melverley (<abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr>), a saying
which has arisen from the fact that this village is continually
flooded by the irruptions of the Severn, and is therefore
a place where ills and misfortunes befall the inhabitant;
to go to Halifax (<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr> <abbr title="Lincolnshire">Lin.</abbr> <abbr title="Oxfordshire">Oxf.</abbr>); to Hexham (<abbr title="Northumberland">Nhb.</abbr> <abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr>);
to Hull. From Hull, Hell, and Halifax, Good Lord deliver
us (<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr> <abbr title="north Lincolnshire">n.Lin.</abbr>), is a saying based on the local history of
the two towns named. At Hull all vagrants found begging
in the streets were whipped and put in the stocks, and at
Halifax persons taken in the act of stealing cloth were
instantly, and without any process, beheaded. Jedburgh
and Lydford (<abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr>) bear a like fame for summary infliction
of punishment. Jedburgh-justice and Jedburgh-law are
proverbial phrases signifying trial after execution. ‘<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">First
hang and draw, Then hear the cause by Lidford law</span>,’ is
amongst Ray’s <cite>Proverbs</cite>, 1678. To send a man to Dingley
couch, or Dinglety-cootch (<abbr title="Ireland">Irel.</abbr>), means to send him to
Coventry. Dingle-i-Coush was an old name for Dingle in
Co. Kerry, a place very remote and inaccessible; to be sent

Stories illustrating Local Stupidity
</div>

<p class="new_para">Deeds such as those for which the Wise Men of Gotham are
famous are localized in various parts of the country. In
Wiltshire people sometimes speak of their western neighbours
as Somerset hedge-cuckoos, in taunting allusion to their
making a hedge round the cuckoo to keep it from flying
away. The natives of Madeley-on-Severn are said to have
tried to secure the cuckoo by standing round it in a ring
with clasped hands; whilst they of Borrowdale sought to
compass the same end by building a wall. Moonraker, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
term for a very foolish person (<abbr title="west Yorkshire">w.Yks.</abbr> <abbr title="Herefordshire">Hrf.</abbr> <abbr title="Oxfordshire">Oxf.</abbr> <abbr title="Hampshire">Hmp.</abbr> <abbr title="Wiltshire">Wil.</abbr>),
has its origin in similar tradition. The Wiltshire moonrakers
are best known to fame, but it is also told of the natives
of Slaithwake that they raked the canal to secure the moon
which was reflected therein, and which they mistook for
a cheese. It has been stated with regard to the existence of
the term in Hampshire, that the original moonrakers were
smugglers who, when detected on their journeyings, were
wont to pitch their booty into one of the numerous ponds
in the district, to be raked out again some night when fear of
pursuit was past. As fond as the folks of Token (<abbr title="Cumberland">Cum.</abbr>) is
a saying based on the tradition that the first coach that
passed through Token was followed by a crowd of the
inhabitants who were anxious to see the big wheel catch
the little one; as fond as th’ men of Belton, at hing’d a sheäp
for stealin’ a man, is a north Lincolnshire expression. A
Coggeshall job means in Essex a stupid piece of work, a foolish
action. Many stories are told in illustration of the stupidity
of the people of Coggeshall, for instance, it is related that
when they had built their church they found they had forgotten
to make any windows. So they got some hampers,
and set them open in the sun to catch the light, then shut
them up tight, wheeled them into the church in barrows, and
there opened them to let the light out. Another legend tells
that the people thought that their church was in the wrong
place. In order to move it, they went to one end to push it,
laying their coats down on the ground, outside the opposite
end, on the spot to which the wall was to be removed. When
they judged that they had moved the building far enough,
they went round to find their coats, but none were to be
found. They at once concluded that they had pushed the
wall over them, and went to look for them inside the church.
Further, they are said to have placed hurdles in the stream
to turn the river, and to have chained up the wheelbarrow
when the dog bit it.</p>

Historical Allusions

<p class="new_para">Among the most interesting of the dialect sayings are
those which contain historical allusions. Here we find the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
memory of old, unhappy, far-off things, and battles long ago,
handed down from generation to generation, enshrined in
some quaint word or phrase. Or perchance it is the name
of some great or notorious man that has now passed into
a rustic proverb, some notable event in political or Church
history which, long after it has ceased to live in men’s minds,
still lingers in their speech. When Durham boys are quarrelling
or playing at soldiers, one may taunt another by crying:
A coward! a coward! o’ Barney Castle Dare na come out
to fight a battle. In all probability this refers to the holding
of Barnard Castle by Sir George Bowes during the Rising of the
North in 1569. The couplet: Bellasis! Bellasis! daft was
thy knowle, When thoo swapt Bellasis for Henknoll (<abbr title="east Yorkshire">e.Yks.</abbr>),
refers to a foolish exchange of estates in the fifteenth century.
An Easter Monday custom peculiar to Ashton-under-Lyne,
called Riding the Black Lad, consisted in carrying through
the streets an effigy which was afterwards publicly burned.
Originally this effigy represented a man in black armour, and
was intended for Sir Ralph Assheton, the tyrannical Black
Knight of Assheton, but later it was made up to resemble
some person who happened to be politically or socially
unpopular in the town. Bloody Mary (<abbr title="west Yorkshire">w.Yks.</abbr>) is a name
for the crane’s-bill, <span class="sci_name">Geranium Robertianum</span>. To vanish in
a bokanki (<abbr title="Durham">Dur.</abbr>) is to take precipitate flight after the manner
of Dr. Balcanqual, Dean of Durham, in the time of the Civil
Wars, who fled from the city with extreme precipitation, after
the battle of Newburn, for fear of the Scots. A reminiscence
of the days when rural England lived in terror of a Napoleonic
invasion is contained in the phrase: marrow to Bonny
(<abbr title="Lakeland">Lakel.</abbr> <abbr title="west Yorkshire">w.Yks.</abbr>), i.e. a match for Buonaparte, equally bad,
applied to any one who bears a very bad character, or who
has been guilty of a bad action. Chewidden Day, Picrous
Day, and the phrase drunk as a Perraner, are all references
to the reputed finders of tin in Cornwall. Tradition tells that
<abbr title="Saint" class="silent">St.</abbr> Perran was one day cooking for himself a humble meal
when a stream of white metal flowed out of the fire which
he had built on a heavy black stone. Great was the joy of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
good saint, for he perceived that there had been revealed
to him from above something which would be useful to man.
He communicated his discovery at once to <abbr title="Saint" class="silent">St.</abbr> Chewidden, and
the two saints soon devised ways and means of producing
this metal in large quantities. They called the Cornishmen
together and told them of their treasures, and how they
could set to work to obtain them. Days of feasting followed
the announcement; mead and metheglin and other drinks
flowed in abundance, and were partaken of so freely by the
saints and their followers, that <abbr title="Saint" class="silent">St.</abbr> Perran’s name from that
day passed into a proverb. The name of Cromwell occurs
in an Irish imprecation: the curse of Cromwell, and in the
Lincolnshire saying: it caps old Oliver, and he capped
Long Crown, i.e. the Cavaliers, so called from the shape of
their hats, said when anything very extraordinary is recounted.
Other versions of this expression are: it caps
Leatherstarn, and he capt the divel (<abbr title="east Yorkshire">e.Yks.</abbr>), it cowes the
gowan (<abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr>), it flogs t’doll (<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr>). A red-haired Dane (<abbr title="Sussex">Sus.</abbr>
<abbr title="Wiltshire">Wil.</abbr> <abbr title="Somerset">Som.</abbr> <abbr title="Cornwall">Cor.</abbr>) is a term of reproach applied to a man with
red hair. Such a man is often said to be crossed wi’ the
Danes, or a bit touched wi’ the Danes. Danes’ blood (<abbr title="Wiltshire">Wil.</abbr>)
is the dwarf elder, <span class="sci_name">Sambucus Ebulus</span>, popularly believed only
to grow on the ancient battle-fields, and to have sprung
originally from the blood of the slain Danes. The same
name is also given to the pasque-flower, <span class="sci_name">Anemone Pulsatilla</span>
(<abbr title="Hertfordshire">Hrt.</abbr> <abbr title="Cambridgeshire">Cmb.</abbr> <abbr title="Norfolk">Nrf.</abbr>), and to the clustered bell-flower, <span class="sci_name">Campanula

clay found in Hampshire. Dane-weed (<abbr title="Northamptonshire">Nhp.</abbr>) is a name for
the field eryngo, <span class="sci_name">Eryngium campestre</span>. A Dane’s skin is
a freckled skin. Derwentwater Lights (<abbr title="Northumberland">Nhb.</abbr> <abbr title="Cumberland">Cum.</abbr>) is a name
for the aurora borealis. On the night of the execution of the
Earl of Derwentwater the aurora borealis flashed with
remarkable brilliancy, and has since been so named in
remembrance of him. Duff’s luck (<abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr>) is a proverb expressive
of some special good fortune. Duff is the family name
of the Earls of Fife, a family which has for many generations
gone on adding land to land, successfully building up huge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
estates. The days of the Duke of Monmouth’s rebellion
are remembered as Dukin’-time (<abbr title="Somerset">Som.</abbr>). Schoolboys in
north Lincolnshire call coloured snail-shells or butterflies
English, the origin of which term dates back to the period
of the long war with France, when children used to kill all
the white butterflies they could find, regarding them as
symbols of the French.</p>

Local Traditions

In West Yorkshire, <abbr title="November">Nov.</abbr> 5 is known as Plot, and a special
kind of cake, made of oatmeal and treacle and called <em>parkin</em>,
is eaten at about that date. A curious bit of testimony to
the popularity of Shakespeare may be traced in the common
Yorkshire expression to play Hamlet (with), e.g. Bai gou,
lad! wen ta gets ’oam ther’ll bi ’amlit to pleay; Mi mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
pleayed ’amlit wi’ ’im fer stoppin’ aht lat at neet. The use
of Hanover in exclamations and mild oaths such as: What
the Hanover do I care about it! (<abbr title="Lincolnshire">Lin.</abbr>), Go to Hanover and
hoe turnips! (e.<abbr title="Suffolk">Suf.</abbr>), is said to date from the time of the
Georges, who were very unpopular in the east of England.
According to an old Cheshire legend, for several days before
the battle of Blore Heath, there arose each morning out of the
fosse three mermaids, who announced: Ere yet the hawberry
[hawthorn-berry] assumes its deep red, Embued shall
this heath be with blood nobly shed. Higgledy-piggledy,
Maupas shot (<abbr title="Cheshire">Chs.</abbr>) means serving all alike, a saying which
is sometimes extended by the addition of: let every tub
stand on its own bottom. The tradition which accounts for
its origin is by some attributed to James I, and by others to
William III. The kernel of the story in either case is the
refusal of the then Rector of Malpas to treat the monarch to
his share of a dinner at the village inn. In spite of the
remonstrances of the Curate, who was also present, the shot
was equally divided between the three: higgledy-piggledy
all pay alike. Later the monarch caused the same rule to be
applied to the benefice, and henceforth the Curate received
a moiety of the glebe and tithes. Hobby-horse Day is a
festival held in Padstow on May 1. A hobby-horse is carried
through the streets to a pool about a quarter of a mile
outside the town, where it is supposed to drink. The
procession then returns home singing a song to commemorate
the tradition that the French, having landed in the bay,
mistook a party of mummers in red cloaks for soldiers, and
hastily fled to their boats and rowed away. Hockney
Tuesday, that is the first Tuesday after Easter week, is
celebrated at Hungerford in Berkshire as Kissing Day, in
accordance with the charter which John of Gaunt gave the
town after its services in some great battle. Two tutty-men
visit each house in the borough, and demand a coin of the
realm from each male, and a kiss from every female. They
each carry a staff about six feet long, bedecked with flowers
and ribbons, the whole being surmounted with a cup and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
spike bearing an orange, which is given away with each
salute, and then replaced by another one. The tutty-men
[nosegay-men] are the tything-men, selected from the
tradesmen of the town, whose duty it was before the establishment
of the county police to act as constables, and assist
in preserving order in the town. Pictures of the proceedings
on Kissing Day appeared in the <cite>Daily Graphic</cite> of April 6,
1910, entitled ‘Hocktide at Hungerford: Quaint thirteenth-century
customs observed’. Hock-Monday in Sussex is kept
as a festival in remembrance of the defeat of the Danes in
King Ethelred’s time. The term Kemble’s Pipe (<abbr title="Herefordshire">Hrf.</abbr>),
applied to the concluding pipe any one smokes at a sitting,
is now no longer in current use. The original Kemble was
executed at Hereford on <abbr title="August">Aug.</abbr>&nbsp;2, 1679, on a charge of implication
in Titus Oates’ plot. On his way to execution he smoked
his pipe and conversed with his friends, and hence arose the
name Kemble’s Pipe for the last pipe smoked in a social
company. The cloud-berry, <span class="sci_name">Rubus Chamaemorus</span>, in many
north-country dialects is known by the name of knout-berry.
A Lancashire tradition derives this name from King Cnut,
or Cnout, who, being reduced to great extremity, was preserved
from starvation by feeding on this fruit. There’s
been worse stirs than that at Lathom is a Lancashire saying
used when a flitting, a whitewashing, or any domestic stir of
an unpleasant nature makes an apology needful on the score
of untidiness or confusion. It alludes to the havoc made
when the Parliamentary forces took Lathom in 1645. To
pull anything Lymm from Warburton (<abbr title="Cheshire">Chs.</abbr>) signifies to pull
anything to pieces. The expression originates from the fact
that the church livings of Lymm and Warburton were
formerly held together, but that they were eventually
separated, and the income of the rectors of Lymm thereby
reduced. Nelson’s bullets (<abbr title="north Country">n.Cy.</abbr>) is the name of a kind of
sweetmeat made in the shape of small balls. A Norman
(<abbr title="Suffolk">Suf.</abbr>) is a tyrannical person. Lord Northumberland’s Arms
(<abbr title="Northumberland">Nhb.</abbr>) is synonymous with a black eye. The 29th of May,
commemorating the Restoration of Charles II, is commonly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
observed in the midland and south-western counties. The
day is variously known as: Oak-apple Day, Oak-ball Day,
Royal Oak Day, and Shick-shack Day. Shick-shack is the
name of the piece of oak, especially one with an oak-apple
attached, which is worn before noon, mostly by school-children.
In the afternoon the shick-shack is discarded, and
monkey-powder, i.e. leaves of the ash, put in its place. In
the evening both emblems have to disappear, or the wearers
are beaten with nettles (<abbr title="Oxfordshire">Oxf.</abbr>). Elsewhere the beating with
nettles is the punishment for not wearing any oak-leaves at
all. In Yorkshire a boy who does not wear the oak is nicknamed
a Papish. The Penny Hedge (<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr>) is a fence or
hedge of wicker-work set up annually on the eastern shore
of Whitby harbour, at the Feast of the Ascension. According
to a legend, dating from 1315, ‘the lords of Sneaton and
Ugglebarnby, with others, whilst hunting the boar, did
mortally injure an hermit, who dared to protect the quarry.’
As penance for this outrage, the local lord and his successors
after him must thenceforth plant a certain number of stakes
every year in the tideway. This performance is now called
the Horngarth Service, or the Setting of the Penny Hedge.
A Cheshire version of a well-known proverb is: When the
daughter is stolen, shut the Peppergate. The proverb is
said to be founded on fact. The daughter of a certain Mayor
of Chester was stolen as she was playing at ball in Pepper
Street, and the young man who carried her off took her
through the Pepper Gate. After the loss of his daughter, the
Mayor ordered the gate to be closed. The case is altered,
quoth Plowden (<abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr>), is a phrase which originated through
the unexpected decisions given by Judge Plowden, an
eminent lawyer in Queen Mary’s time. A <em>pussivanting</em> (<abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr>
<abbr title="Cornwall">Cor.</abbr>) is an ineffective bustle; used as an adjective the word
is equivalent to meddling, fussy. It is undoubtedly a corruption
of <em>poursuivant</em>, but whether the original Poursuivants
from whom the term is derived were those sent into
Cornwall in the fifteenth century, threatening punishment
for the blackmailing habits of certain Cornish sea-captains,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
or whether they were the Poursuivants of the latter part of the
seventeenth century, who were sent to search out all those
entitled to bear arms, is a matter on which opinions differ.
The name of Queen Anne is used to denote a coloured
butterfly (<abbr title="Cheshire">Chs.</abbr>), an ancient gun (<abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr>), and an old-fashioned
tale (<abbr title="north Yorkshire">n.Yks.</abbr>), e.g. Tell us some o’ your aud Queen Anners.
Queen Anne’s flowers (<abbr title="Norfolk">Nrf.</abbr>) is a name for the daffodil;
Queen Anne’s needlework (<abbr title="Northamptonshire">Nhp.</abbr>) is the striped crane’s-bill.
Queen Mary’s thistle (<abbr title="Northamptonshire">Nhp.</abbr>), the cotton thistle, <span class="sci_name">Onopordon
Acanthium</span>, owes its name to the tradition that it was
brought to Fotheringay by Mary’s attendants. Various
plants are named after Robin Hood, e.g. Robin Hood’s
feather, or fetter (<abbr title="Cumberland">Cum.</abbr>), the traveller’s joy, <span class="sci_name">Clematis Vitalba</span>;
Robin Hood’s hatband (<abbr title="Cumberland">Cum.</abbr> <abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr>), the club moss, <span class="sci_name">Lycopodium
clavatum</span>; Robin Hood’s men, or sheep (<abbr title="Lincolnshire">Lin.</abbr>), the
bracken fern, <span class="sci_name">Pteris aquilina</span>. To go round by Robin Hood’s
barn (<abbr title="Cambridgeshire">Cmb.</abbr> <abbr title="west Midlands">w.Midl.</abbr>) is to go a roundabout way, to go the
farthest way; Robin Hood’s wind (<abbr title="Cheshire">Chs.</abbr>) is a wind which
accompanies a thaw. It is said that Robin Hood could stand
anything but a thaw wind. A Yorkshire proverb runs:
Many speak of Robin Hood, that never shot his bow, i.e.
many people talk of doing great things which they can never
accomplish. It’s long o’ comin’, like Royal Charlie (<abbr title="Ireland">Irel.</abbr>),
is said of a thing that has been long expected. A Scarborough
warning (<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr> <abbr title="Norfolk">Nrf.</abbr>) signifies no warning at all.
The origin of the saying rests on the statement that in 1557
Thomas Stafford entered and took possession of Scarborough
Castle before the townsmen were aware of his approach.
Sherra-moor (<abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr> <abbr title="Northumberland">Nhb.</abbr> <abbr title="Durham">Dur.</abbr>), used to signify a row, tumult,
a state of confusion, is originally a name given to the Rebellion
of 1715. The title of Vicar of Bray (<abbr title="Berkshire">Brks.</abbr>) is applied
as a term of contempt to a turncoat.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
Historical Value of Loan-words
</div>

<p class="new_para">Apart from isolated scraps of history preserved in epithets
and sayings such as these, there is the mass of historical
evidence that can be gleaned by a careful study of the loan-words
in the dialects. We have already noted many of
them, but only for their philological value. To estimate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
their importance from an historical point of view they would
have to be treated geographically, the point of consideration
being not the form in which they are found, but the locality.
Thus we should obtain valuable corroborative testimony to
known historical facts, regarding the settlement of the British
Isles. For instance, history tells us that some time before
the Norman Conquest some Flemish people settled in
England. John of Trevisa wrote: ‘<span lang="enm" xml:lang="enm">The Flemmynges, that
woneth in the west syde of Wales, habbeth yleft here strange
speche and speketh Saxonlych ynow.</span>’ But in learning
English they carried over into the new language some of their
own words, and these Flemish words brought in by these
colonists have remained in the dialects of those counties
which lie on the west side of Wales, e.g. south Pembroke and
Glamorganshire.</p>

<p class="new_para">The loan-words, further, give living support to written
history in pointing back to the existence of Frisians in Kent,
the Isle of Wight, and Hampshire; to an early settlement
of people from the south-west of England in Wexford; to
the influx of Scots into Ulster; and of Huguenots into
Norfolk. They prove, too, that far more Normans settled
in the south-midland and southern counties than in the rest
of England; that the Scandinavian settlers in East Anglia
were to a great extent Danes; and that the Scandinavians
in Northumberland, Durham, Cumberland, Westmorland,
Yorkshire, and Lancashire were chiefly Norwegians.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2" id="Footnote_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> The Carlyles, however, used this phrase in a different sense.
Mrs. Carlyle in a letter to her husband (September&nbsp;13, 1844) wrote:
‘The evening of the Bullers’ departure Jenkin’s Hen came, pale as
a candle, with a red circle round each eye which was very touching;—he
had evidently been crying himself quite sick and sore.’ Carlyle’s
note on this passage is as follows: ‘Fleming. To “die the death of
Jenkin’s hen” expressed in Annandale the maximum of pusillanimity.’

<span class="sub_head">SUPERNATURAL BEINGS</span></h2>

<p class="new_para">A book such as this cannot pretend to do justice to the
mine of folk-lore which even the most superficial acquaintance
with the dialects opens up to any one who cares to
delve therein. Here we meet with the outward and visible
signs of old superstitions of mythical origin, popular beliefs,
faith in charms, and quaint medical lore concerning all kinds
of human ills, betokening a strange mixture of Christianity
and creeds of heathen times, of pious faith and childlike
dread of the unknown and mysterious still existing in the
minds of our rural population. Very many of these old
superstitious beliefs and practices are, as we should naturally
expect, dead and gone, or traceable only in shadowy legend
and story, the marvel is that so many are yet alive in spite
of the spread of education. Indeed, superstition is by no
means a monopoly of the uneducated or semi-educated mind,
the only difference is that where the rustic gives free expression
to his fears and fancies, we disguise ours from the public
gaze under a cloak of mockery or of would-be science.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
Local Apparitions
</div>

<p class="new_para">Among the outworn superstitions is the belief in all those
imaginary beings that peopled the darkness of long ago.
They have nearly all disappeared, except that the names of
some of them have been added to the list of that hideous
crew of fictitious personages invented to terrorize the young.
They are chiefly monstrous animals, and goblins, some
harmless, some terrific and of evil omen; the ghost, as the
spirit of the departed, is a minor character on the stage.
The dialect terms: <em>fearing</em>, <em>frittening</em>, <em>summat</em>, <em>things</em>, usually
imply ghostly appearances of any shape, not specially
human. The same may be said of the word <em>know</em>, e.g. The
know of a dog, is the shape of a dog when the dog is not there.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
<em>Ghostlin</em> is a contemptuous term for an apparition, one which
might be used by a person born on Christmas Day, for such
are born ghost-free to the end of their lives. To <em>come again</em>
is the common phrase for the supposed return of the dead,
e.g. You remembers ’Arry Whitly as was cut t’pieces an the
line? Well, he comes agen strong, in six pieces; or the dead
man may be said to be <em>troublesome</em>, e.g. I can’t never bide in
th’ouse—the poor old Harry’s that troublesome. Here and
there some special ghost keeps its local habitation and name,
as for instance, Spotloggin, the ghost of a murdered man
which haunts a certain ditch near Evesham in Worcestershire.
It appears after dark to any one who attempts to
cross the ditch at a point where there is no hedge on the
bank, and where according to tradition no hedge will grow,
it being the precise spot where the murder took place. We
may presume that few do venture to pass that way, and
encounter the veritable ghost, for its identity is still a matter
of question. Some who ignore the commonplace murder
story, maintain that Spotloggin was ‘a lady of that name who
used to patch her face, and was supposed to be very proud’.
Speaking generally, however, I think it may be said that it
is rather the educated mind which concerns itself with ghosts
of this kind. A lady historian of Shropshire folk-lore tells
us that her inquiries after ghost-stories had more than once
been met by this answer from the country rustic: I dunna
believe as there’s anythin’ in it, as the dead come back.
If they bin gone to the good place they wouldna want to
come back, and if they bin gone to the tother place they
wouldna be let to.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
Boggarts
</div>

<p class="new_para">The generic name for an apparition, whether ghost or hobgoblin,
is <em>boggart</em> or <em>boggard</em>, <abbr title="compare">cp.</abbr> ‘<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">a boggarde</span>, <em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">spectrum</span></em>’, Levins,
<cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Manipulus Vocabulorum">Manip.</abbr></span></cite> 1570. Many an old Hall in Lancashire had its own
private and particular boggart, as for instance, the Boggart
of Clegg Hall, the Clayton Hall Boggart, the Clock House
Boggart, <abbr class="silent" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> The Clock House Boggart was wont to stalk
through the bedchambers at dead of night, and strip the
bedclothes off the sleepers; or it would sit, a gigantic, white-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>robed
figure, perched solemnly in a large yew-tree, beneath
which tree it was ultimately laid by an assemblage of divines.
The Clayton Hall Boggart was likewise notorious for its
nightly pranks—snatching the clothes off beds, trailing heavy
weights across floors, and the like—till at last it became so
insufferable that steps had to be taken to lay it. One of the
best ways of laying a boggart was to beguile it into consenting
to keep away ‘while hollies are green’. The average
boggart, being too dull-witted to perceive the true inwardness
of the suggestion, easily fell into the trap, and was never able
to appear again. Aw’m heere agen, like the Clegg Hall
Boggart, is, or used to be, a popular saying commemorating
one of these well-known ghosts. A horse that starts at any
object in the hedge or road is said to take the boggart. In
Cheshire the word denotes a scarecrow, a meaning familiarized
to us by Caldecott’s illustrations to <cite>The Three Jovial Huntsmen</cite>:</p>

kepeth nothinge, even so are their goddes of wod, of sylver
and golde</span>,’ Coverdale (1535), <em>Baruch</em> <abbr title="chapter 6 verse 69">vi. 69</abbr>. The most
dramatic and awesome of all the boggarts is the north-country
Barghest, a frightful goblin armed with teeth and
claws, having eyes as big as saucers, and loaded with
heavy chains, which rattle and clank, like Herne the Hunter
who ‘<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">shakes a chain in a most hideous and dreadful manner</span>’,
<cite><abbr title="The Merry Wives of Windsor">Merry Wives</abbr></cite>, <abbr title="Act 4 scene 4 line 33"><span class="act">IV.</span> iv. 33</abbr>. Sometimes the Barghest takes the
shape of a large dog, donkey, pig, or calf; sometimes only
its terrifying shrieks are heard, as it passes by at midnight,
boding death to any one who happens to hear the sound.
It has long been a prominent figure among apparitions, and
various attempts have been made to account for its name.
Some folklorists think that the word is a corruption of
<em>barn-ghaist</em> [ghost], others suggest <em>bier-ghaist</em>, and others,
with a sense of the picturesque, say it is <em>bar-ghaist</em>, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
the spectre had a habit of sitting on the top rail of a gate or
fence, waiting, ready to leap on to the shoulder of the belated
wanderer. But whatever its origin, the name yet lives in
proverbial sayings such as: to roar like a barghest (<abbr title="Durham">Dur.</abbr>),
and as a term of abuse (<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr> <abbr title="Nottinghamshire">Not.</abbr>), e.g. You noisy bargust,
said to a child, or: Y’er allus i’ th’road, yer young bargest,
ger out! Church-grim (<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr>) is a fixed inhabitant of the
church by day and by night, and only ‘marauds about’ in
dark stormy weather. It has been known to toll the death-bell
at midnight, and at times a priest officiating at a burial
would see it sitting at a window in the church-tower, when
he would be able to tell by the creature’s aspect whether the
soul of the departed was saved or lost. Clap-cans (<abbr title="Lancashire">Lan.</abbr>) does
nothing beyond making a noise as of beating on empty cans.
Gally-trot (<abbr title="north Country">n.Cy.</abbr> <abbr title="Suffolk">Suf.</abbr>) is the name of an alarming apparition
in the shape of a dog, and of the size of a bullock. It is
white, and somewhat shadowy of outline, and it gives chase
to any one who runs away from it in fear. The word is
derived from <em>gally</em>, to frighten, scare, and may also be used
as a common term for ghostly objects in general, though
it sounds almost slangy, and one could fancy that in spectral
circles it might be deemed an impertinence to speak—let us
say—of the Barghest of York as a mere gally-trot. A
guytrash (<abbr title="north Country">n.Cy.</abbr> <abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr>) is an evil cow whose appearance was
formerly believed in as a sign of death. Jack-in-irons (<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr>)
is a supernatural being of great stature, wearing clanking
chains, who may at any moment spring out on a passer-by in
the dark. Old Baker, Old Bendy, and Old Lob are just
ordinary boggarts. Pad-foot is a terrible boggart with
saucer-eyes, and dragging clanking chains; or it takes the
form of a large sheep or dog walking beside you, making
a soft noise—pad, pad, pad—with its feet. It always portends
disaster. Old Shock (<abbr title="East Anglia">e.An.</abbr>) is a mischievous goblin
in the shape of a great dog or calf, haunting highways and
footpaths after dark. Those who are so foolhardy as to
encounter the beast are sure to be thrown down and
severely bruised. Skriker (<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr> <abbr title="Lancashire">Lan.</abbr>) is an apparition por<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>tending death.
It wanders about in the woods by night
uttering loud, piercing shrieks, its form being then invisible.
At other times it takes visible shape as a large dog, with
enormous feet and shaggy hair, and the usual saucer-eyes.
When walking, its feet make a splashing noise, as of a person
in old shoes walking in soft mud; hence it is also known by
the name of Trash, for to <em>trash</em> signifies to walk wearily
through wet and mire, and <em>trashes</em> are worn-out shoes.</p>

Unlike the Gabriel Ratchets, which fly too high in the air to

bleak and dreary moors on tempestuous nights, and woe
betide the unlucky wretch who chances to cross their path.
A story is told of a poor herdsman who was journeying home
across a moor, one windy night, when, above the noise of the
storm, he heard behind him the howl of the yelping dogs, and
the grim halloa of the hunter. Presently they had so gained
on him, that, glancing back, he could see the terrible saucer-eyes,
horns, and tail of the hunter, a black form, carrying
a long hunting-pole, and the mass of dogs, each snorting fire
and uttering frightful yelps. But just as they were about
to spring upon him, by a happy inspiration he fell on his
knees in prayer, and the foe was rendered powerless. The
hell-hounds stood for a moment at bay, howling dismally, and
then, led by their master, they drew off and disappeared.
These phantom hounds, jet-black, and breathing flames are
also known by the name of Heath-hounds; Yeth-hounds
(<abbr title="Somerset">Som.</abbr> <abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr> <abbr title="Cornwall">Cor.</abbr>), and Wisht-hounds (<abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr> <abbr title="Cornwall">Cor.</abbr>).</p>

<p class="new_para">To roar like Tregeagle is a Cornish phrase, whereby hangs
a tale. One tradition tells that Tregeagle was a steward in
the reign of James II, who made himself unpopular by his
harshness to the tenantry, and another legend bases his claim
to notoriety on his being a Cornish Bluebeard, who married
several heiresses for their money, and afterwards murdered
them. But whether for cruelty to tenants, or murder of
wives, as a punishment for his sins his spirit was doomed to
toil for ever at impossible tasks such as weaving sand, and
emptying perennial pools with a cockle-shell. When the
Devil is so minded he amuses himself by hunting this miserable
ghost over the moor with his hell-hounds, at which time
Tregeagle is heard to roar and howl in so dreadful a manner
that his name has passed into a proverb.</p>

The Seven Whistlers
</div>

<p class="new_para">The Seven Whistlers are mysterious birds, the sound of
whose cry is a sign of some great calamity. Miners have
been known to refuse to go down the pits the day after hearing
it, believing that some accident would befall them if they
did so. The superstitions concerning the Seven Whistlers
vary in different parts of the country, from Lancashire to
Essex and Kent. Wordsworth records of his ancient
Dalesman:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="p_line">And counted them.</div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p class="cont">In parts of Shropshire and Worcestershire they were, according
to the legend, seven birds, six of whom fly about continually
looking for the seventh, and when they find him, the
world will come to an end. The idea of the wailing of
unseen birds sent by Providence as a direct warning of
approaching danger belongs more particularly to colliery
districts, though it is not confined to them. Just as behind
the stories told of the Gabriel Ratchets is the natural cry of
migrating wild geese, so the voice of the Seven Whistlers can
be traced to passing flocks of widgeon, curlews, or plovers.
Indeed, the name is actually given in some places to these
birds: I knows what makes the noise; it’s them long-billed
curlews; but I never likes to hear them (<abbr title="Kent">Ken.</abbr>).</p>

Names for imaginary Monsters

of every sort and description, from the plain unadorned

bogy to thee—to the highly dramatic figure of the skeleton
that haunted the wicked murderer, crying, Oi want my
booans, Oi want my booans! Pictures such as this, when
presented to the vivid imagination of children, doubtless gain

one shudders to think of the effect they must produce on
impressionable minds, though in the majority of cases, no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>

The simple form <em>Bug</em>, a bogie, is apparently obsolete, remaining
only in the phrase <em>to take bug</em> (<abbr title="Midlands">Midl.</abbr>), to take fright.
Dr. Johnson has: ‘Bug. Bugbear.... A frightful object;

charge of the green gooseberries, e.g. If ye goos out in the

deep pits, ponds, and wells. When children approach too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
near to the edge of her domain, she will stretch out her long,
sinewy arms, seize them, and drag them under the water,
holding them there till they are drowned. Her presence is
indicated by a green scum on the surface of the water. If
there is no pond or deep water for her near by, she has been
supposed to take up a temporary lodging in the tops of
trees, where after nightfall she may be heard moaning, in
a voice like the sighing of the night-wind through the branches
of trees. In some parts of the country, instead of Jenny
Green-teeth, the boggart of the ponds is a masculine water-demon
called Rawhead (<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr> <abbr title="Lancashire">Lan.</abbr> <abbr title="Lincolnshire">Lin.</abbr> <abbr title="Warwickshire">War.</abbr> <abbr title="East Anglia">e.An.</abbr>), Tommy

Cornish Sprites
</div>

<p class="new_para">Bucca, Gathorns, Knockers, Nicker, Nuggies, and Spriggans
are individual and collective appellations for the sprites
that haunt the tin-mines of Cornwall. They hardly belong
to the boggart tribe of spectres whose business it is to terrify
mortals with gruesome sounds and horrid shapes. They are
for the most part a harmless folk, occupied in mining on
their own account, out of sight of the human miners. These
latter, however, take pains not to annoy the goblin workers;
whistling and swearing, for instance, are held to be obnoxious
to mine-spirits, and must therefore be avoided. Once upon
a time there was a miner called Barker, who was foolhardy
enough to say he did not believe there were any Knockers.
In revenge for this insult, a crowd of Knockers waylaid him,
and pelted him with their tools, causing him a lifelong injury,
whence grew up the proverb: As stiff as Barker’s knee.
Bucca is an Old Cornish word for hobgoblin. Nicker is the
same word as Old English <em><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">nicor</span></em>, a hippopotamus, a water-monster,
in which latter sense it is found in the dialect of
the Shetland Islands. This water-goblin is probably the
original of Nickerbore (<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr>), of whom it is related that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
sat on the wrong side of a branch which overhung a stream,
to saw it off, and in consequence fell into the water. Tell
Nickybore, don’t tell me, is equivalent to: Tell that to your
grandmother. The Knockers know where to find the most
productive lodes, and sometimes they reward an industrious
miner by pointing out to him where he might take a good
tribute pitch. They are generally heard working deep
underground, but at no great distance, for the rolling of
barrows, the stroke of pickaxes, and the fall of earth and
stones are distinctly heard, and sometimes voices seem to
mingle with these sounds. Some say that these phantom
toilers are the souls of the Jews who formerly worked the
Cornish tin-mines, and who, for their wicked practices as
tinners, have never been allowed to rest; others suppose
them to be the ghosts of the Jews that crucified Jesus, who
were sent as slaves by the Roman Emperor to work the tin-mines.
The association of the mine-spirits with the Jews is
based on the historical fact that after the Conquest, the tin-mines
of Cornwall and Devon were farmed by Jews, as is
proved by charters granted by several kings of England, more
especially by King John, and further corroborated by the
existence of such terms as: <em>Jews’ bowels</em>, small pieces of
smelted tin found in old smelting works; <em>Jews’ houses</em>, very
old smelting places; <em>Jews’ leavings</em>, mine refuse; <em>Jews’
pieces</em>, very ancient blocks of tin.</p>

<p class="cont">Some people have connected herewith the Led-will superstition
formerly current in East Anglia, explaining the
phrase as meaning led-by-will, i.e. by Will-o’-the-wisp.
Led-will is defined as an influence under which the victims,
though perfectly sane and sober, lose themselves on well-known
paths. It causes farmers to walk round and round
their own familiar fields for hours without finding the exit,
and to make short circular tours in their gigs, returning to
the point whence they started. Persons under this influence
must always travel in circles, and the only way of escape is
to turn some article of their clothing. The most probable
meaning of the term is led astray, <em>will</em> representing <abbr title="Old Norse">O.N.</abbr>

Steele, <cite>Guardian</cite>, 1713; the Leprachaun (<abbr title="Ireland">Irel.</abbr>), the fairy
shoemaker; Robin-round-cap (<abbr title="east Yorkshire">e.Yks.</abbr>). This benevolent
and humble sprite, though very useful when properly
treated, would disappear, or become openly mischievous, if
annoyed. Chief among the things whereat he would take
offence is the offering of recompense for his labours. A hob-thrust,
who used to wear an old tattered hat when at work,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
found a new one put for him in his accustomed haunt,
whereupon he straightway departed, crying: New hat, new
hood, hobthrush’ll do no more good. If the farmer or any
of his servants had spoken disrespectfully of the hobthrush,
they would presently find cream-pans smashed to atoms,
horses and cattle turned loose and driven into the woods,
and the housewife’s churning would produce no butter.
Sometimes the Hob or Dobby (<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr> <abbr title="Lancashire">Lan.</abbr>) is famous only for
whimsical pranks of this nature. The popular story of the
goblin who was so troublesome that the farmer and his
family packed up their goods and quitted the house, only
to find that they were carrying the goblin too amongst the
household stuff, is also told of the north-country Hob. I see
you are flitting, said the neighbour, met by the way, Ay, we’s
flitting, came the voice of Hob from out of the churn. Weel,
an’ thou’s ganning teea, Ah’ll just awa’ back agen, rejoined
the farmer. A certain Yorkshire Hob, who had his dwelling
in a cave, was noted for curing children of the whooping-cough,
when thus invoked by those who took them to his
abode: Hob-hole Hob! Mah bairn’s getten t’kin’-cough:
Tak’ ’t off! Tak’ ’t off! Though nowadays these sprites
are dead and forgotten, we occasionally find a trace of them
preserved in a common phrase or proverbial saying, for
instance: Master Dobbs has been helping you (<abbr title="Sussex">Sus.</abbr>), an
expression used to a person who has done more work than
was expected. When a man boasts of being a good workman,
as of the great number of things which he can make in a day,

<p class="new_para">The conception of the Devil as a giant capable of prodigious
muscular feats, but so dull of intellect that he is
easily outwitted by the simplest rustic, may be traced in
the Devil’s Spadeful legend that clings to certain isolated
hills in different parts of the country. The Devil’s Spadeful
near Bewdley in Worcestershire is a sort of moated
mound, easily seen from the Bewdley-Kidderminster loop
railway. Tradition tells that the Devil was approaching
Bewdley carrying a spadeful of earth, with which he intended
to dam up the Severn just below the town, and so destroy it
and all the inhabitants by a flood. At the point where the
mound now stands he met a cobbler, laden with a sack of
old boots and shoes which he was taking home to mend. The
Devil had lost his way, and was feeling weary under his
burden, so he asked the cobbler how far he must yet travel
before reaching Bewdley. ‘I cannot say how far it is,’
replied the cobbler, ‘I only know that I have worn out all
these boots and shoes on the road since I started.’ Whereupon
the Devil relinquished his project in despair, and threw
down his spadeful on the spot. Another version of the story
adds that the cobbler himself was buried under the mound.
The present mound could quite well suffice for a tumulus,
but as a dam for the Severn it would seem inadequate. The
same story belongs also to the Wrekin. The Devil, having
a spite against the Mayor and all his people, wished to
submerge the town of Shrewsbury. After throwing down
his load, which formed the Wrekin, the Devil scraped his
boots on his spade, and the mud which he scraped off was
such a pile that it made the little Ercall hill by the Wrekin’s
side. Silbury Hill near Devizes is said to possess a version
of this legend.</p>

The Devil in Local Place-names
</div>

<p class="new_para">There are in various places isolated heaps of stones
associated with the Devil, and called Devil’s Lapfuls. One
such heap exists in the parish of Winsford in Somerset.
It is a large scattered heap chiefly of quartz boulders on the
brow of a hill, and no stones of the like formation are to be
found anywhere near. It is said that the Devil meant to
build a bridge over the Barle, close by, with these stones,
which he had brought from a long distance, when his apron-string
broke, and the stones fell where they now are, and
whence they cannot be removed. Not to be altogether
deterred from his purpose, the Devil afterwards built the
bridge called Tarr-steps with the great slabs of slaty rock
found on the spot. Not far from the village of Stanton
Harcourt near Oxford are three large stones known as
the Devil’s Quoits. According to local tradition, the Devil
played here with a beggar for his soul, and won by throwing
these huge boulders.</p>

<p class="new_para">A legend which connects the Devil with the building of
a church may be found all over England in varying forms.
The site of the church having been selected, stones were
brought thither, and the work begun, but each night the
Devil came and carried the stones away, laying them down
on the spot where the church now stands. The workmen,
tired of labouring in vain, gave up the original site, and
adopted that chosen by the Devil, and thenceforth the
building went on unmolested. In Shropshire the site which
cannot be built upon is always at the top of a hill, but this
is not invariably the case elsewhere.</p>

Pixies and Fairies
</div>

<p class="new_para">It is difficult to classify all the supernatural beings known
to dialect lore, otherwise than very roughly, for even a cursory
glance at the whole mass of superstitions and fancies regarding
them shows that there is great confusion of idea between
fairies and witches, bogies and goblins. Sometimes it is the
fairies who terrify the stabled horses at night, sometimes it is
a witch; here the benevolent Hob has been at work, and
there his doings are ascribed to a pixy. The following may,
however, rank as Fairies: the Derricks (<abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr>), a species of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
dwarfish fairies, of somewhat evil nature; Nanny Button-cap

<p class="cont">Fenodyree, or Phynnodderee (<abbr title="Isle of Man">I.Ma.</abbr>), a fallen fairy, who was
banished from fairyland for having paid his addresses to
a Manx maiden, and for deserting the fairy court during the
harvest moon to dance with her in the Glen of Rushen.
Stories are told of the great strength of Fenodyree. On one
occasion, when he was cutting grass, harrow-pins were
placed in the meadow to annoy him, but he cut them through
without effort, merely remarking: ‘Hard stalks, hard stalks.’
Gancanagh (<abbr title="Ireland">Irel.</abbr>), who appears in lonesome valleys, and
makes love to milkmaids. Collective names are: the Fair
Folk, or Gueede Neighbours (<abbr title="north-east Scotland">ne.Sc.</abbr>), polite phrases used
to avoid mentioning the name Fairies, which they were supposed
to dislike; the Gentle People, or Gentry (<abbr title="Ireland">Irel.</abbr>), to
whom old hawthorn trees growing singly were sacred. An
old man who ventured to cut down one such tree was
shortly afterwards stricken with rheumatic fever, and the
circumstance was declared to be a judgment of the gentry
upon him. Henkies (Sh. &amp; <abbr title="Orkney Isles">Or.I.</abbr>), so called because they
were supposed to <em>henk</em> or limp when they danced, <em>Henkie
knowes</em> are the knolls round which these trolls or fairies used
to gambol at night; the Hill Folk (<abbr title="Shetland Isles">Sh.I.</abbr> <abbr title="Lancashire">Lan.</abbr>); the Piskies,
or Pixies (<abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr> <abbr title="north, south and south-west Country">n. s. and sw.Cy.</abbr>), believed in some districts
(<abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr> <abbr title="Cornwall">Cor.</abbr>) to be the souls of unbaptized children which have
become sprites; the Small Folk, or Small People (<abbr title="Cornwall">Cor.</abbr>), supposed
to have dwindled in size, and turned into <em>muryans</em>
[ants], wherefore it is deemed unlucky to destroy a colony of
ants. Popular etymology has made out of the common double
plural form fairyses, a singular Pharisee (<abbr title="Warwickshire">War.</abbr> <abbr title="Worcestershire">Wor.</abbr> <abbr title="East Anglia">e.An.</abbr>),
which among children gives rise to endless mistakes between
the fairies of the story-books and the Pharisees of the Bible.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
The Fairies in Plant-names
</div>

<p class="new_para">The associating of the fairies with certain plants and fungi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
leads to the formation of very picturesque plant-names, for
example: Fairy’s-bath, or Fairies’ bath (<abbr title="Sussex">Sus.</abbr> <abbr title="Hampshire">Hmp.</abbr>), the
fungus Jew’s ears, or blood-cups; Fairy-butter (<abbr title="north Country">n.Cy.</abbr> <abbr title="East Anglia">e.An.</abbr>
<abbr title="Hampshire">Hmp.</abbr>), a species of fungus, of yellowish colour and gelatinous
consistence, found growing upon rotten wood. The fairies
are supposed to amuse themselves at night by flinging their
butter so as to make it adhere to gates and doors. It is
thought very lucky to find it inside a house. Fairy-bell
(<abbr title="Ireland">Irel.</abbr>), Fairy-fingers (<abbr title="Durham">Dur.</abbr> <abbr title="Cumberland">Cum.</abbr> <abbr title="north Yorkshire">n.Yks.</abbr>), Fairy-glove (<abbr title="Ireland">Irel.</abbr>
<abbr title="Dorset">Dor.</abbr>), Fairies’-petticoats (<abbr title="Cheshire">Chs.</abbr>), Fairy-thimbles (<abbr title="Cambridgeshire">Cmb.</abbr> <abbr title="Norfolk">Nrf.</abbr>
<abbr title="Essex">Ess.</abbr>), the foxglove; Fairies’-table (n.<abbr title="Wales">Wal.</abbr>), the common
mushroom; Fairy-cheeses (<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr>), the dwarf mallow;
Pixy-glove (<abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr>), a thistle; Pixy (<abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr>), the greater stitchwort,
concerning which children say that if you gather the
flowers you will be pixy-led; Pixy-pear (<abbr title="Hampshire">Hmp.</abbr> <abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr>), the
hip, the fruit of the dog-rose, or (<abbr title="Dorset">Dor.</abbr> <abbr title="Somerset">Som.</abbr>) the haw, the
fruit of the hawthorn; Pixy-stool (<abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr> <abbr title="Hampshire">Hmp.</abbr> <abbr title="Somerset">Som.</abbr> <abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr>
<abbr title="Cornwall">Cor.</abbr>), a toadstool or mushroom. To pixy (<abbr title="west Somerset">w.Som.</abbr>), or to go
pixy-wording, is to glean stray apples in an orchard after
the trees have been stripped. Fossil echini turned up by
the plough, or found on the sea-shore are termed Fairy-loaves,
or Pharisee-loaves (<abbr title="Gloucestershire">Glo.</abbr> <abbr title="East Anglia">e.An.</abbr>). There is a saying in
Norfolk: If you keep a fairy-loaf you will never want bread.
The ‘green sour ringlets’ ‘whereof the ewe not bites’ are
still known as Fairy-rings (in <abbr title="general dialect">gen. dial.</abbr> use), or Pixy-rings
(<abbr title="Somerset">Som.</abbr> <abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr>). It is thought safer to walk round them rather
than across. Old legends say that by running round a fairy-ring
nine times on the first night of the full moon, sounds of
mirth and revelry may be heard from the subterranean
abode of the elves, who make this their dancing-green; or
again, that on peaceful nights faint echoes of music, and the
pattering of tiny feet, may be wafted down from the hill-sides.
It is said that the fairies were wont of old to wash their
clothes in Claymore Well (<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr>), and mangle them with the
<em>bittle and pin</em>. The <em>bittle</em> is a heavy wooden battledore;
the <em>pin</em> is the roller; the linen is wound round the latter,
and then rolled backwards and forwards on the table by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
pressure on the battledore. The strokes of the bittles on
fairy washing-nights could be heard a mile away. The
following story of a fairy in the capacity of the benevolent
sprite used to be told in one of the southern counties of
England. Once upon a time there was a young woman who
married a thresher. Soon he turned out to be a hopeless
drunkard; his work was neglected, and starvation stared
them in the face. So the woman dressed herself in her
husband’s clothes, and went to the barn to do the threshing
whilst he slept off the effects of his drunkenness. On the
morning of the second day she found her pile of threshed
corn double what she had left there overnight, and this
increase was repeated for three or four nights in succession.
She determined to watch one night and discover who was
her unknown helper. Presently she beheld a little pixy
come into the barn, and set to work vigorously to thresh the
corn, and as he swung his flail he sang:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>

<div class="sidenote">
Fairy Benevolence
</div>

<p class="cont">Out of pity and gratitude, the woman next day made him
a tiny suit of clothes, and hung them up behind the barn door
beside his flail. At night when the pixy returned to work,
he saw the clothes, and put them on at once. Then, surveying
himself with satisfaction, he sang:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p class="cont">With that he disappeared, and never came back any more.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
Mischievous Fairies
</div>

<p class="new_para">Dr. Johnson defines ‘Fairy’ thus: ‘A kind of fabled
beings supposed to appear in a diminutive human form,
and to dance in the meadows, and reward cleanliness in
houses.’ The reward was bestowed in the form of a coin
secretly placed in the shoe of the industrious servant, an
ancient belief which was, we are told, long kept alive by
mistresses, who would slip the expected coin into its place
to encourage their servants to industry. But the fairies did
not everywhere possess only this blameless reputation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span> Mischievous fairies were dreaded by the farmer’s wife lest
they should get into the dairy and spoil the cream. To keep
them away, every one who entered the dairy must stir up
the cream with the mundle (<abbr title="Worcestershire">Wor.</abbr>). A tangled knot in a
horse’s mane was proof of their having been in the stable,
for this was the <em>pixy-seat</em> (<abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr>). A trace of what Dr. Johnson
calls ‘an odd superstitious opinion, that the fairies steal
away children, and put others that are ugly and stupid in
their places’, remains in the dialect saying: Bless th’ bairn,
he must hev been chaanged (<abbr title="Lincolnshire">Lin.</abbr>), used when a child,
generally good-tempered, becomes suddenly irritable without
any obvious reason. Country folk in Cornwall used to put
a prayer-book under a child’s pillow as a charm to keep
away the pixies. The still prevailing superstition that it is
unlucky for a woman after child-birth to go into anybody’s
house—some say even to cross her own threshold—before
she goes to be churched, is no doubt a remnant of the old
belief that the mother until <em>kirk’t</em> was not safe from the
power of the fairies. People suddenly seized with rheumatism,
lumbago, paralysis, or fits were supposed to have been
shot at by malicious fairies, and when a prehistoric arrow-head
of flint or stone was picked up, it was alleged to be the
fairy weapon, the <em>awf-shot</em> or fairy-dart. A hole in a deal
board occasioned by the dropping out of a shrunken knot,
was regarded as the path of a fairy shaft, and called an
<em>awf-bore</em>. In Northumberland and Cumberland a sudden
attack of illness or disease is still spoken of as a <em>shot</em>, e.g.
a shot of rheumatics. The phrase Plaze God and the pigs
(<abbr title="west Somerset">w.Som.</abbr>) is probably a reminiscence of the days when the
pigseys or pixies were regarded as powers which had to be
reckoned with in ordinary daily life. To laugh like a pixy
(<abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr> <abbr title="Cornwall">Cor.</abbr>) is to laugh heartily, like the merry elves of yore
when they danced in the meadows by moonlight.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
Belief in Witchcraft
</div>

<p class="new_para">The belief in witches as active personalities belongs, together
with the belief in fairies, to bygone generations, but
its traces are with us still. On the one hand there are the
old words and phrases, the husks of a once living seed, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
on the other hand is the vague superstitious dread of an evil
influence which is none the less real and potent because
people have ceased to ascribe the dreaded ill-luck to witchcraft
and the evil eye. Among the plants associated with
witches are: Witch-bells (<abbr title="north Country">n.Cy.</abbr>), the corn blue-bottle;
Witch’s-milk (<abbr title="Lancashire">Lan.</abbr>), the common mare’s-tail; Witch’s-needles
(<abbr title="Northumberland">Nhb.</abbr>), the shepherd’s needle; Witch’s-knot (<abbr title="Westmorland">Wm.</abbr>),
a bundle of matted twigs which forms on the branches of
birches and thorns. The fungus which we have already
noticed under the name Fairy-butter, is also known as
Witch’s-butter (<abbr title="Northamptonshire">Nhp.</abbr> <abbr title="west Country">w.Cy.</abbr>); and the purple foxglove is
sometimes called Witch’s-thimble (<abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr> <abbr title="Northumberland">Nhb.</abbr>). When horses
break out into a sweat in the stable, they are said to have
been hag-rided (<abbr title="Somerset">Som.</abbr>); and the tangled locks in their manes
are the Witch’s-stirrups (<abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr>). In parts of Surrey and
Sussex a Fairy-ring is called a Hag-track. The shoulder-bones
of a sheep are termed Hag-bones (<abbr title="Somerset">Som.</abbr>), because
formerly witches were believed to ride on them, and consequently
it was necessary to burn them. The ancient belief
that the shells of eggs used by the household were appropriated
by the witches for boats is still regarded in practice, the spoon
must be thrust through the bottom, or the shell crushed to
pieces before it is thrown away, <abbr title="compare">cp.</abbr> Sir Thomas Browne and
his annotators: ‘<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">To break the egg-shell after the meat is out,
we are taught in our childhood, and practise it all our lives;
which nevertheless is but a superstitious relique, according
to the judgment of Pliny ...; and the intent hereof was to
prevent witchcraft.</span>’ ‘To keep the fairies out, as they say
in Cumberland,’ Note (<abbr title="Jefferson">Jeff.</abbr>); ‘<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Least they perchance might
use them for boates (as they thought) to sayle in by nigh</span>t,’

<div class="sidenote">
The Evil Eye
</div>

<p class="new_para">As ill as a witch (<abbr title="Cheshire">Chs.</abbr>) is a phrase meaning very ill. As
fause [false, i.e. cunning] as a Pendle witch (<abbr title="Lancashire">Lan.</abbr>) is a
saying which keeps on record the traditional association of
Pendle Forest with witches. It was there that the old
custom called Lating [seeking] the Witches used to be
observed on All-hallows Eve, the night when the witches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
were said to meet in the Forest. Lighted candles were
carried about the hills from eleven to twelve o’clock. If the
witches failed to extinguish a light, the bearer was safe from
their power for the season, but if the light went out, it
portended evil. Persons or things under the supposed
influence of witchcraft or the evil eye, were formerly said
to be <em>blinked</em> (<abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr> <abbr title="Ireland">Irel.</abbr> <abbr title="Cheshire">Chs.</abbr> <abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr> <abbr title="East Anglia">e.An.</abbr>), a word which still
remains in <abbr title="East Anglia">e.Anglia</abbr> in the sense of soured, spoiled, used of
beer. The very common word <em>wisht</em> (w. and sw. Cy.),
meaning unlucky, uncanny, also physically weak, sickly,
haggard, is no doubt originally <em>wished</em>, i.e. ill-wished, or
bewitched. The terms <em>overlooked</em> (<abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr> <abbr title="Ireland">Irel.</abbr> <abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr> <abbr title="Warwickshire">War.</abbr> <abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr>
<abbr title="East Anglia">e.An.</abbr> <abbr title="south-west Country">sw.Cy.</abbr>), <em>overseen</em> (<abbr title="Herefordshire">Hrf.</abbr> <abbr title="Gloucestershire">Glo.</abbr>), <em>overshadowed</em> (<abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr>) were
certainly used in their original sense of bewitched as late as
the last two decades of the nineteenth century, <abbr title="compare">cp.</abbr> ‘The last
witness said deceased had been “overshadowed” by some-one,’

<cite>Times</cite>, <abbr title="February">Feb.</abbr>&nbsp;21, 1912, regards the belief in this form of
witchcraft as still current: ‘We still hear of people in

cast upon them.’</p>

Ill-Omens

<p class="new_para">A White Witch was a person, either man or woman, who
was supposed to possess the power of removing the spell, and
of inflicting punishment on the individual by whose malice
the evil had been wrought. In return for pecuniary considerations,
the white witch dispensed oracular wisdom, and
remedies in the form of charms. As recently as the year
1890 a man who called himself ‘the White Witch of Exeter’
was convicted on a charge of obtaining money by means
of palmistry. Mrs. Sarah Hewitt in her book on Devonshire
customs and folk-lore—<cite>Nummits and Crummits</cite>—writes:
‘In cases of sickness, distress, or adversity, persons
at the present time (<span class="small_all_caps">A.D.</span> 1898) make long expensive journeys
to consult the white witch, and to gain relief by his (or her)
aid.’ The miscellaneous articles and medicaments advocated
by the white witch we shall notice later when we come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
to consider charms and cures. Meanwhile let us first look
at some of the many ways in which the old fear of mysterious
evil still shows itself, that fear which in spite of our advances
in education and civilization still makes men regard trivial

which is attached the idea of a death-portent. This warning

announced by a bird or some other animal; it may even lurk
in the most innocent flower. The following are sure signs of
death: If a small oblong cinder flies out of the fire it is
called a <em>coffin</em> (<abbr title="north Country">n.Cy.</abbr>) and betokens death, especially if it lies
silently where it fell; but if, on the other hand, it makes

Terrifying Apprehensions

<p class="cont">A large hole in the crumb of a loaf is a <em>grave</em> (<abbr title="Berkshire">Brks.</abbr>), or
a <em>coffin</em> (s.<abbr title="Nottinghamshire">Not.</abbr>). When the tallow or wax of a candle runs
down on one side it often projects and then reunites to the
candle, forming a sort of loop; this is a <em>coffin-handle</em> (<abbr title="west Somerset">w.Som.</abbr>),
and is a sign of death to the person in whose direction it
forms itself. The same superstition holds when the grease
from the guttering candle forms a broad solid mass, popularly
termed a <em>winding-sheet</em>. A piece of charred wick at the
top of a burning candle is a <em>death-lowe</em> [-flame] (<abbr title="Cumberland">Cum.</abbr>), or
a <em>shroud</em> (<abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr> <abbr title="Lincolnshire">Lin.</abbr> <abbr title="Somerset">Som.</abbr>), and presages death, unless the
flame be extinguished by immersing the candle in running
water. When furniture creaks suddenly it betokens death,
but some say it only means a serious illness. If a clock,
a picture, a looking-glass, or a flitch of bacon falls, it portends
death; so does a table-cloth, when it is badly folded, and
has a crease in the form of a diamond in the centre. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
letters cross in the post; if the church clock strikes while
the text of the Sunday morning’s sermon is being given out,
or while the last hymn is being sung; if a piece of land has
been accidentally missed in ploughing or sowing, it is a sign
of death. The sound of singing in the ears is the <em>dead-bell</em> (<abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr>).
In some districts the choking sensation in the throat known
as the <em>rising of the lights</em> is held to forebode death, but more
usually it is regarded as an insignificant physical condition,
to be remedied by swallowing small shot, the weight of
which will keep the <em>lights</em> in their proper place. To break
a looking-glass; to open an umbrella in the house, especially
if it is held over the head; to put the bellows on the table;
to drop a comb—are all deeds which forebode somebody’s
death. The belief that if three people take part in making
up a bed there is sure to be a death in the house within the
year, is a superstition which I found was held to in my own
house, together with the very common one that it is unlucky
to turn a mattress on a Friday or Sunday.</p>

Portents of Death

common is the death-watch, also known as the <em>dead-chack</em>

of rational presage or just cause of terror unto melancholy
and meticulous heads. For this noise is made by a little
sheath-winged grey insect, found often in wainscot benches

In some parts of England the sound of the cricket in the
house is esteemed lucky (<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr> <abbr title="Northamptonshire">Nhp.</abbr> <abbr title="Cornwall">Cor.</abbr>), in other parts
unlucky (<abbr title="west Country">w.Cy.</abbr>); and again, there are districts (<abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr>) where
it is looked upon as a death-portent. If a swarm of bees
settles on the wall of a house, or on a dead tree, or wooden
stake, it is a sign of an approaching death in the family; if
they <em>knit</em> on the ground, it is a sure sign of a berrin’ [funeral].
A death in the family may also be presaged by the sudden
death of a pig. I remember just twenty years ago, when an
old cook, whom I knew very well, inquired after my brother
who was then recovering from a severe attack of scarlet-fever,
she concluded the conversation by saying: ‘I knew
quite well that there would be a serious illness in your
family, because you had told me that one of the pigs had
died suddenly.’ The sudden departure of rats from a house
is sometimes held to betoken the death of one of the inmates.
A white bird flying past, or a dove flying against a window
at night, or flying into a room, is a sign of death. In some
places, any bird pecking at a window announces death, but the
robin is the chief harbinger of death, whether he announces
his message by tapping at the window, chirping on the sill,
or by hopping into the room. In the winter of 1910, a tame
robin used to cause considerable uneasiness in this household
by coming into the house through the open windows. If
a crow settles on a house, one of the inmates will die within
the year. If a hare or a white rabbit crosses your path; if
you hear a hen crow; if the cock crows at midnight; or if
a cow lows three times in your face, it is a sign of death,
as are, too, the midnight hooting of owls, and the howling of
dogs. In the Miracle Play in Longfellow’s <em>Golden Legend</em>,
when the Rabbi asks Judas Iscariot ‘Why howl the dogs at
night?’ the answer is:</p>

<p class="cont">If children pick the Herb Robert it means death to one or

is called Mother-dee (<abbr title="Cumberland">Cum.</abbr>). If the child pluck the red
species, its father will perish, or if the white, then the mother
will die. It is very unlucky to bring pieces of the spindle-tree
into the house, hence it is the Death-alder (<abbr title="Buckinghamshire">Bck.</abbr>); but

Magpie Rhymes
</div>

<p class="new_para">The magpie is always an ominous bird. Seen singly, it is
everywhere taken as a sign of evil, but the significance of
two or more varies in different parts of the country. The
commonest version of the magpie rhyme is: One for sorrow;
Two for mirth; Three for a wedding; Four for a birth.
Other versions are: Yan is sorrow; Tweea is mirth; Three
is weddin’; Fower is birth; Five is silver; Six is gold;
Sebben is a secret, nivver to be told (<abbr title="north Country">n.Cy.</abbr>). Yen’s sorry;
Twee’s morry; Three’s a wedding; Fower’s deeth; Five’s
hivin’; Six is hell; And Sivin’s the deel’s aan sel (<abbr title="Northumberland">Nhb.</abbr>).
One, sign of anger; Two, sign o’ muth; Dree, sign o’
wedding-day; Vower, sign o’ death; Vive, sign o’ zorrow;
Zix, sign o’ joy; Zebm, sign o’ maid; An’ eight, sign o’ boy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
(<abbr title="west Somerset">w.Som.</abbr>). To avert these indications you may use one of
the following charms: raise the hat in salutation; make
a cross with your foot on the ground, or as many crosses as
there are magpies; wet the forefinger with spittle, and
therewith make the sign of the cross on your shoe; make
the same sign by crossing the thumbs; spit on the ground
three times, and say: Devil, devil, I defy thee! Magpie,
magpie, I go by thee! If a shrew-mouse runs over your
foot, it portends ill-luck, sometimes the coming ill-luck
is defined as paralysis of the foot. In Sussex the country
people have an idea that the shrew-mouse is unable to cross
a path which has been trodden by man. Whenever it
attempts to do so it is said to be immediately struck dead,
and hence the number of shrew-mice which may be found
lying dead in lanes or on field footpaths. If a hare crosses
the path of a woman with child, she must instantly stoop
down and tear her shift, or the child will have a hare-lip, or
<em>’ar-shotten</em> lip, as it is called (<abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr>). This superstition is no
doubt connected with the old belief that a witch often took
the form of a hare. They never dow [prosper] that strange
dogs follow, is a Yorkshire saying. It is very unlucky to
drive away a black cat, if a stray one should come into the
house. An Oxford landlady told us quite recently that she
had driven away a black cat from her door shortly after she
was married, some twelve years previously, and since then
she had ‘buried twenty-three relations’! It is unlucky
when moving house to transport the cat; it is also unlucky
to allow a cat to die in the house, hence when it begins to be
ill, it is better to drown it. It is unlucky to keep a kitten
born in May, for: May chets Bad luck begets. In the North
a May cat is supposed to suck the breath of the baby in the
cradle, if opportunity offers; while in some south-western
districts it is said to bring adders and <em>varmints</em> into the house.
Goslings hatched in May will not bring gain to the owner;
and it is an evil month for marriage. Scotch people especially,
even among the well-educated, have a strong prejudice
against marrying in May. Marry in May, You’ll rue it for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
aye, is a Devonshire saying. There is an old rhyme against
short-coating babies in May: Tuck babies in May, You’ll
tuck them away, but this is perhaps merely a health warning,
parallel to: Don’t cast a clout Till May is out, based on the
uncertain temperature of the month of May. It is very
unlucky to kill a swallow, a robin, or a wren, and even to
take their eggs is a sacrilegious act certain to bring ill-luck,
for: The Robin and the Wren Are God Almighty’s cock and
hen. The Martin and the Swallow Are God Almighty’s
scholars. Other versions of this rhyme are: Martins and
swallows Are God’s teachers and scholars. Robins and wrens
Are God’s chickens and hens. Those who kill a robin or
a wren Will never prosper, boy or man. Swallows and
martins bring luck and prosperity under the roof around
which they build, and hence it is a bad sign if they forsake
a house where they have been accustomed to build, <abbr title="compare">cp.</abbr>
‘<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Though useless to us, and rather of molestation, we commonly
refrain from killing swallows, and esteem it unlucky

gods of the ancients, and therefore were preserved</span>,’ <cite>Vulgar
Errors</cite>, <abbr title="Book 5, Chapter 14">Bk. V, Chap. XXIV</abbr>. It is also unlucky to kill a ladybird,
God Almighty’s colly-cow (<abbr title="Hampshire">Hmp.</abbr>); or to kill a spider.
If you wish to live and thrive Let the spider run alive, is
a current Berkshire rhyme. The little red spider, when
found, should be put in the pocket, for it means money.
Spiders’ webs sometimes escape destruction through a belief
that such a web concealed our Lord as He lay in the manger
from the messengers of Herod. The Sun-beetle is God’s
horse (<abbr title="Cumberland">Cum.</abbr>), and like the Rainy clock, or Thunder clock
(<abbr title="Cumberland">Cum.</abbr> <abbr title="Westmorland">Wm.</abbr>), is supposed to cause terrible storms if it be
killed. It is very unlucky to bid a price for an animal, such
as a cow, pig, or horse, when it is not for sale, for if this is
done the animal is sure to die. To covet another man’s beast
is to <em>heart-eat</em> (<abbr title="Lancashire">Lan.</abbr> <abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr>) it, and an animal so coveted will
not prosper. It is unlucky to sell bees, or to hive a swarm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
after nightfall. To kill a pig when the moon is waning
means ill-luck with the bacon, it is sure to shrink in the pot.
Some say it will not take the salt, and cannot therefore be
cured. Nor must cider be made at such times, else the
apples when gathered will <em>shrump up</em>, and the cider will
turn sour. It is unlucky to look into an owl’s nest. Once
upon a time a foolhardy person ventured to do so, and in
consequence he became melancholy, and <em>destroyed hissell</em>. It
is important to give a hen an odd number of eggs to sit on,
if this is not done, most of the eggs, if not all of them, will
be addled. The regulation number is thirteen. It is very
unlucky to spill salt, or to help another to salt, or to break
a salt-cellar, though the misfortune may be averted by
throwing a pinch of salt over the left shoulder. She that
pricks bread with fork or knife Will never be happy maid
or wife (<abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr>), the thing must be done with a skewer. It
is unlucky to hang a picture over a door. When you have
set out on any business, or started on a journey, it is very
unlucky to turn back and re-enter the house, but if it is
absolutely necessary to return, the evil may be counteracted
by sitting down on a chair before starting again. Some say
even to look back is unlucky, and in this case they connect
the superstition with the fate of Lot’s wife. Pick up pins,
pick up sorrow, is a saying which is contradicted by other
versions such as: See a pin and pick it up, All the day you’ll
have good luck; and: See a pin and let it lie, You’ll want
a pin before you die. Mend your clothes upon your back,
Sure you are to come to wrack. It is unlucky to use elder-wood
for lighting a fire; to burn bones, or evergreens; to
decorate a house with peacock’s feathers; to bring the eggs
of any wild bird into the house. When a child’s tooth comes
out, it must be dropped into the fire, and the following rhyme
repeated, or the child will have to seek its tooth after death:
Fire, fire, tak’ a beean, An’ send oor Johnny a good teeath
ageean (<abbr title="east Yorkshire">e.Yks.</abbr>); or a little salt must be placed on the tooth,
which is then carefully put into the fire with the words:
Fire, fire, burn beean, God sen’ my tiuth ageean (<abbr title="Lakeland">Lakel.</abbr>).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
Another idea is that unless the tooth is burned, the one which
grows in its place will prove a dog’s tooth. If a baby’s first
tooth appears in the upper jaw, it is a bad sign, it may mean
that the child will die in infancy. The bairn at cuts its teeth
abeen, ’Ill nivver see its mairidge sheen, is an old Scotch
saying. Similarly, if the teeth grow with irregular spaces
between them, the child will not be a long liver: If a bairn
teeathes odd, It’ll seean gan to God (<abbr title="east Yorkshire">e.Yks.</abbr>). But a gap
between the two front teeth wide enough to pass a sovereign
through, is a sign of luck and wealth. It is unlucky to
weigh a child, or to let it see its face in the glass before it
is a year old; or to call it before baptism by the name you
mean to give it. If an engaged couple have undertaken to
be godparents to a child, it is unlucky for them both to
stand at the font together, it would presage a parting within
three months. A local instance of this came to my knowledge
less than six months ago. The difficulty was solved by the
godmother taking her place in a pew at a little distance
from the rest of the party assembled round the font. In
Cornwall they say: first at the font, never at the altar. It
is unlucky to sing early in the morning: If you sing afore
bite You’ll cry before night; to see the new moon for the
first time through a window; to have the Bishop’s left hand
on your head at confirmation. If you enter another person’s
house with your left foot foremost, you draw down evil on
the inhabitants. A new broom should sweep something into
the house before it is used in the contrary direction, otherwise
you sweep good luck away from your threshold. Some people
hold that you must never sweep the dust out of doors, but
always into the fire, for fear lest you sweep the blessing out
(<abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr>). Friday is proverbially an unlucky day everywhere.
Friday’s a day as’ll have his trick The fairest or foulest day
o’ the wik (<abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr>), <abbr title="compare">cp.</abbr> ‘<span lang="enm" xml:lang="enm">Selde is the Fryday al the wyke i-like</span>,’
Chaucer, <cite><span lang="enm" xml:lang="enm">Knightes Tale</span></cite>, <abbr title="line">l.</abbr> 681. It is very unlucky to start out
on a journey; to remove from one house to another; to enter
upon a new service; or to set a hen on a Friday, but specially
unlucky is it to begin new undertakings on Good Friday.

If clothes are washed that day some member of the family
will die before the year is out. A Yorkshire superstition
holds that if clothes are hung out to dry that day they will
be taken in spotted with blood. On the other hand, it is
esteemed lucky to plant potatoes, and to sow all kinds of
garden seeds on Good Friday. Beans and peas, for instance,
sown on this day yield better crops than they would if sown
any other day. Moreover, it is the best day in all the year
to begin weaning babies. In parts of Devonshire it is thought
lucky to break pottery on Good Friday, because then the
points of every sherd are supposed to pierce the body of
Judas Iscariot. If a bunch of quaking grass, called maidenhair
(<abbr title="Norfolk">Nrf.</abbr>), is brought into the house it is sure to bring ill-luck;
trouble will also ensue if you cut down the house-leek,
the <em>sungreen</em> (<abbr title="Sussex">Sus.</abbr>), which grows on walls and roofs. If you
should happen to dig up a mandrake, you must quickly
burn it, for anybody that looks at it will at once go blind. To
pick flowers before they are full-blown causes a <em>pouk</em> (<abbr title="Worcestershire">Wor.</abbr>)
or sty in the eye. Marsh-marigolds are called <em>drunkards</em>
(<abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr> <abbr title="Wiltshire">Wil.</abbr>) because if you pick them, or even look long at
them, you will take to drink. Poppies are called <em>ear-aches</em>
(<abbr title="Derbyshire">Der.</abbr> <abbr title="Nottinghamshire">Not.</abbr>) because if gathered and put to the ear, a violent
attack of ear-ache will be the result. In parts of Yorkshire
the poppy is known by the name of <em>blindy-buff</em>, because if
you hold a poppy to your eyes it will blind you. North-country
children deem it unlucky to gather the flowers of the
<em>cuckoo-spit</em>, the Lady’s smock, <span class="sci_name">Cardamine pratensis</span>. To
bring two or three primroses into the house of an owner of
poultry in early spring, before any chickens are hatched,
means bad luck to the sittings of eggs; but if the number
of primroses is thirteen or upwards, there is nothing to fear.
Old Manx people held a like superstition about daffodils,
believing it to be unlucky to bring them into the house before
the goslings were hatched. This connexion with geese
probably accounts for the Manx name for the daffodil,
<em>Lus-ny-guiy</em>, the goose-leek. It is a sign of a parting if two
bells ring together in a house; if a loaf parts in two when it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
is being cut; if a cake has a hollow cavity in the centre. To
give a knife, a pair of scissors, or a pin of any sort to a friend
will cut love, unless some coin is received in exchange. To
stir the tea in the tea-pot is to stir up strife. Other signs of
a coming quarrel between friends are: to cross knives; to
put the poker and tongs on the same side of the fireplace; to
put a pair of boots on the table, but here the quarrel may
be averted if some one immediately puts the boots under
the table; to pass your friend on the stairs. If two persons
kindle a fire together; or dip their hands into the same
basin of water; or together wipe their hands on the same
towel, they will inevitably quarrel. In the case of the
washing of hands, the sign of the cross made over or in the
water will prevent the quarrel.</p>

across the nose, You’ll never live to wear your wedding-clothes,

this peculiarity is deemed a favourable omen. In some
Yorkshire districts the idea is that a person so marked will

A <em>gift</em> on the thumb indicates a present; on the forefinger

finger a visit to pay; on the little finger a journey to go.
A gift on the thumb is seer ti cum, Bud yan on the finger is

<p class="new_para">It is considered lucky to be born on a Sunday; to have
<em>lucken-toes</em> (<abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr>), that is toes joined by a web or film; to
have a mole on the neck, though some say if it is on the back
of the neck it is a sign that you will be hanged. If you’ve
a mole above your chin, You’ll never be beholden to any of
your kin (<abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr>); but a mole on the side of the nose is a sign

in your cheek, Your living to seek; A dimple in your chin,
You’ll have your living brought in (<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr>). It is a lucky
omen to put on any article of clothing the wrong side out,
but it must be done accidentally, and not changed during
that day. Any one making a first appearance in new clothes
should be pinched by a friend to ensure good luck: Pinch
you for your new dress (<abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr>). My grandmother always
wished the possessor: Health to wear it, Strength to tear it,
And money to buy another, a formula still repeated in
Northumberland, if not elsewhere. It is lucky to put the
left stocking on first; to stumble on ascending stairs, steps,
or ladders; to find a flint arrow-head, known as a <em>thunder-bolt</em>
(<abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr>); to find nine peas in a pod; to find a four-leaved
clover; to find an even-ash, that is an ash-leaf with an even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
number of leaflets. When found, it should be put in the
bosom, or worn in the hat, for luck. It is lucky to meet
a flock of sheep on the highway when you are making
a journey. Good luck for a grey horse (<abbr title="west Yorkshire">w.Yks.</abbr>) is a common
expression of children, accompanied by the act of spitting
over their little finger, at the sight of a grey horse, an action
which is supposed to bring good luck. In parts of Lincolnshire
they spit for a white horse, in anticipation of a present
to come. It is a sign of good luck if a <em>cuddy</em> [wren] or <em>cutty</em>
builds in your hayrick (<abbr title="Dorset">Dor.</abbr>); if rooks build near the house;
if a bird drops upon you, especially if this should happen on
Easter Day; if a spider crawls over you, or falls upon your
face from the ceiling. If a Cornish miner should meet a snail
as he is on the way to the mine, he would drop before it
a crumb from his dinner, or a bit of grease from his candle,
to ensure good luck. To find a toad in the tin-mine is an
augury of good luck to the miner. If when you hear the
cuckoo for the first time you turn a penny over in your
pocket, you will never be without one all the year. Some
say that if when you first hear the cuckoo the sounds proceed
from the right hand, it signifies that you will be prosperous,
but if from the left, ill-luck is before you. If the
first lamb that you see in spring has its head towards you,
it is an omen of good luck for the whole year, but if the tail
is towards you, misfortune will be your lot. According to an
old Scotch proverb ‘dirt’s luck’, so that in moving from one
house to another it is unlucky to get possession of a clean
house, swept and garnished by the outgoing tenant. An old
usage for bringing luck to a new house was for the incoming
tenant to go into every room bearing in his hands a loaf and
a plate of salt. This was termed the <em>house-handsel</em> (<abbr title="north Yorkshire">n.Yks.</abbr>).
In the North-country dialects <em>handsel</em> is the name for a gift
conferred at a particular season, or on commencement of
a new undertaking, to confer luck. The gift of a coin, for
instance, to the wearer of a new suit of clothes makes the
suit lucky. Sometimes money is returned for luck by the
seller to the purchaser, and is called the <em>turn-again</em> (<abbr title="north Lincolnshire">n.Lin.</abbr>),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
<em>luck-penny</em> (<abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr> <abbr title="north Country">n.Cy.</abbr> <abbr title="Northamptonshire">Nhp.</abbr> <abbr title="Warwickshire">War.</abbr>), or <em>luck-brass</em> (<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr>). Thus
what is given back to the buyer of a pig may be termed
<em>penny-pig-luck</em>. The customary payments in Lincolnshire
were one shilling per head for a beast, sixpence for a calf and
a pig, two shillings per score for sheep above a year old, one
shilling per score for lambs; for horses varying sums
according to their value. As late as 1898, Lincolnshire
auctioneers were allowing <em>luck-money</em> to purchasers, at the
rate of one shilling per head on cattle, and a penny per head
on sheep and pigs.</p>

Protection against Ill-luck
</div>

<p class="new_para">The dried tip of a calf’s tongue is called a <em>lucky-bit</em> (<abbr title="Northamptonshire">Nhp.</abbr>)
and is worn in the pocket, partly as a protection against
danger, but chiefly because it is supposed that the pocket
containing it will never be without money. The coracoid
bone of a fowl carried in purse or pocket is believed to bring
money-fortune, whence the name <em>lucky-bone</em> (<abbr title="Cheshire">Chs.</abbr> <abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr>).
This name is also given to a small bone taken from the head
of a sheep (<abbr title="Northumberland">Nhb.</abbr> <abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr> <abbr title="Lancashire">Lan.</abbr> <abbr title="Northamptonshire">Nhp.</abbr>), worn about the person
to produce good luck. Its form is that of a T cross, whence
may perhaps have originated the peculiar sanctity in which it
is held. A <em>lucky-hole</em> (<abbr title="Oxfordshire">Oxf.</abbr> <abbr title="Berkshire">Brks.</abbr>) is a hole bored in a wayside
stone or pillar, to blow through which is considered to ensure
good luck. A stone or pebble with a natural hole through
it is commonly called a <em>lucky-stone</em>. In Dorsetshire the
finder of such a stone picked it up, spat upon it, and then
threw it backward over his head, accompanying the action
with the words: Lucky-stone! Lucky-stone! go over my
head, And bring me some good luck before I go to bed.
A hairy caterpillar, called a Tommy Tailor (<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr>), may also
be thrown over the head for luck. A black snail seized by
the horns and tossed over the left shoulder brings good luck
to the performer of the action. If it is done by a person who
has within the last three days become engaged to be married,
the course of true love will run considerably more smoothly
than would otherwise have been the case. If a person is
setting out on a journey, one of the family sometimes turns
the fire-tongs for luck (<abbr title="Northumberland">Nhb.</abbr>). To spit on a stone, and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
throw it away, is another means of ensuring a prosperous
journey. To carry a badger’s tooth in the pocket is a good
thing to do, for it brings luck at cards (<abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr>). To kill a toad
is said to make bees swarm; and to burn an old shoe is
a charm to help goslings to leave the shell at hatching time.</p>

A Story of Noah

<p class="new_para">The following are a few miscellaneous legends, superstitions,
and popular beliefs: According to an old belief in
Yorkshire, when a pot is taken off the hooks or <em>kelps</em> hanging
in the chimney over the fire, care must be taken to stop the
vibration of the chain as soon as possible, for whilst it is in
motion the Virgin weeps. From Scotland comes the explanation
of the black spots on each shoulder of the haddock:
they are the marks left by the finger and thumb of <abbr title="Saint" class="silent">St.</abbr> Peter
when he opened the fish’s mouth to take out the piece of
money, <abbr title="vide">v.</abbr> <cite><abbr title="Saint Matthew">St. Matt.</abbr></cite> <abbr title="chapter 17 verse 27">xvii. 27</abbr>. The dark marks across the
shoulders of a donkey are said to be the sign of the cross
imprinted in remembrance of Christ’s triumphal entry into
Jerusalem (<abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr> <abbr title="Oxfordshire">Oxf.</abbr>). A Berkshire folklorist relates the
following curious legend which explains why a dog’s nose
and a woman’s elbow are always cold, where there is good
health: ‘In the days of the flood the Ark sprung a small
leak, and Noah, who had forgotten to bring carpenter’s tools
on board with him, was at his wits’ end how to act. His
faithful dog had followed him to the place where the leak
was, and stood watching the influx of water. In his trouble
Noah seized the dog and crammed his nose into the leak.
This stopped it, but in a few moments Noah perceived that
the dog must die if kept in this position any longer. By
this time Noah’s wife had come up and was standing by his
side watching what was taking place. Noah thereupon
released the dog, and taking his wife’s arm stuffed her elbow
into the crack. The danger was thus averted, but a dog’s
nose and a woman’s elbow will remain cold as long as the
world lasts.’ <cite>Glossary of <abbr title="Berkshire">Brks.</abbr> Words</cite>, <abbr class="silent" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, Lowsley, 1888.</p>

Legendary Natural History

carries them off sticking on his spines. You’ve yer back up

Puckeridge (<abbr title="Sussex">Sus.</abbr> <abbr title="Hampshire">Hmp.</abbr>), is a name of the night-jar, also
applied to a fatal distemper in calves, supposed to be caused
by the attacks of night-jars. A certain red beetle, <span class="sci_name">Telephorus
lividus</span>, is called Sucky-blood (<abbr title="Cumberland">Cum.</abbr>), from a local belief that
it lives by sucking the blood of cattle. The Glastonbury
thorn, or Holy thorn (<abbr title="Warwickshire">War.</abbr>), possesses a curious legendary
history. Tradition says that Joseph of Arimathaea came to
England, and visited Glastonbury. Being weary after
climbing the hill, he halted, leaning on his staff to rest. The
stick sank into the soft ground by the wayside, and took
root, and grew, and became the famous thorn-tree which is
said to blossom on Christmas Day. Christ’s cross is supposed
to have been made of the wood of the aspen, and hence the
leaves have continued to tremble ever since. The berries
of the mountain-ash are called <em>cock-drink</em>, or <em>cock-drunks</em>
(<abbr title="Lakeland">Lakel.</abbr>), because they are reputed to possess the property
of intoxicating fowls. The fungus, <span class="sci_name">Nostoc commune</span>, a kind of
white jelly often found in poor pastures, is termed: Star-falling
(<abbr title="Northamptonshire">Nhp.</abbr>), Star-shot (<abbr title="Lincolnshire">Lin.</abbr> <abbr title="Northamptonshire">Nhp.</abbr>), Star-slubber (<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr>
<abbr title="Lancashire">Lan.</abbr>), Star-slutch (<abbr title="Cheshire">Chs.</abbr>), from a belief that it has fallen
from the stars. The fossil bones of the saurians, found in
northern Yorkshire, are called Fallen angels’ bones, being
supposed to belong to the angels who were cast out of

teeth were said to be Giants’ teeth (<abbr title="north Yorkshire">n.Yks.</abbr>). Up
and down the brooks and streamlets in the dingles round

but this is the local legend, and the evidences for its veracity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
anybody may see. Once upon a time there lived a holy lady
of some renown, called <abbr title="Saint" class="silent">St.</abbr> Catherine of Ledbury. One day
a mare and a foal belonging to her were discovered to be
missing. There was no doubt they had been stolen. So
the saint betook herself to prayer, beseeching that the
thief might be traced, and that she might recover her
property. But the thief had anticipated the probability of
a search, and had chosen the brook courses as being rocky
and unlikely to retain footprints. Howbeit, in answer to
the saint’s prayers the rocks did retain the marks, and there
they are to this day, the larger footprints of the mare, the
smaller ones of the foal, and the patten-marks of the old
woman who stole them away.</p>

<span class="sub_head">CHARMS AND MEDICAL LORE</span></h2>

<p class="new_para">Charms for warding off unseen harm and danger, and for
curing bodily ills were of course much more numerous, and
more generally accredited in the early decades of last century
than they are to-day. But even now some still survive, like
the horseshoe, which people still pick up, and hang over
doors and chimney-pieces ‘for luck’, unconscious of the fact
that they are thus preserving an old superstitious device
for counteracting the power of witches. Another curious
survival is the placing of the poker against the top bar of
the grate. People who do it tell you in all seriousness that
it draws the fire up by creating a draught. It really is an
ancient charm against witches, as Dr. Johnson explained to
Boswell: ‘“Why, Sir, do people play this trick which I observe
now, when I look at your grate, putting the shovel against
it to make the fire burn?” Johnson. “They play the trick,
but it does not make the fire burn. <em>There</em> is a better (setting
the poker perpendicularly up at right angles with the grate).
In days of superstition they thought, as it made a cross
with the bars, it would drive away the witch.”’ <cite>Life of
Dr. Johnson</cite>, Vol. II, p. 376. Again, many educated people
habitually ‘touch wood’ if they have given vent to some
expression of satisfaction over their own good health or
fortune, or that of any member of their family. They say
with a laugh, ‘I suppose I must touch wood,’ and do it with
no conscious thought of averting the evil eye, but if the
trick were omitted, the speaker would probably feel uncomfortable
afterwards.</p>

Devices to drive away Witches
</div>

<p class="new_para">The various devices for keeping off witches, and for defeating
their craft can only here be illustrated by a few instances.
To drive away witches by means of fire was part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
ceremony of <em>saining</em> once practised in Scotland at the
birth of a child. A fir-candle was lighted and carried three
times round the bed, or if this could not be done, it was
whirled three times round the heads of the mother and
child; a Bible and bread and cheese were placed under the
pillow, and the following words were repeated: May the
Almichty debar a’ ill fae this umman, an be aboot ir an bless
ir an ir bairn. In the Shetland Islands when a woman
suspected of witchcraft entered a house, the inmates—on
her leaving—would throw a firebrand after her, at the same
time saying: Twee-tee-see-de, doo ill-vam’d trooker. If
ther’s a witch onywheäre aboot, an ye’r scar’d at she’ll
oherlook ye, you mun goä an pull a dook o’ thack [handful of
thatch] oot’n her hoose eavins, an bo’n it, then she can’t
do noht to ye (<abbr title="Lincolnshire">Lin.</abbr>). A red-hot iron thrust into the cream
in the churn, or into the fermenting beer in the brewing-vat
expelled the witch that was frustrating the labours of the
dairy-maid, or the brewer. In 1882 a man living in Shropshire
found in a crevice in one of the joists of his kitchen
chimney a folded paper, sealed with red wax, containing
these words: ‘I charge all witches and ghosts to depart from
this house, in the great name of Jehovah and Alpha and
Omega.’ A well-known plan for working mischief, practised
by malevolent persons, was to make a small figure in
wax, and then pierce it with innumerable pins. This was
supposed to give the victim severe stabbing pains in the limbs.
To reverse this injury the victim might hang in his chimney
a bullock’s heart stuck with pins (<abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr>). In the Somerset
County Museum at Taunton may be seen pigs’ hearts full
of pins. If a pig died owing to the <em>overlooking</em> of some
malignant witch, it seems to have been a custom to take its
heart, pierce it with as many pins and thorns as it would hold,
and then hang it in the chimney, in the belief that as the
pig’s heart dried up and withered, so would that of the evil
person who had bewitched the pig. I remember, hardly
more than twenty years ago, being told of a man then living
near Banbury, who earned a livelihood by making little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
images to be stuck with pins for witchcraft purposes.
To crook the thumb (<abbr title="north Country">n.Cy.</abbr>), that is, to double the thumb
within the hand, is a charm against witchcraft; so also is
the use of the expression: It’s Wednesday all the world
over (<abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr>). A bunch of ash-keys carried in the hand, or the
left stocking worn wrong-side out, were supposed to be good
safeguards against the power of witchcraft, but the favourite
charms were horseshoes, silver, spittle, and the sign of the
cross. A witch who had turned herself into a hare, for
instance, could only be hit by a crooked sixpence, or a silver
bullet. In some districts it was customary to put a silver
coin, or a silver spoon into the churn when the butter would
not come. A newly-calved cow was formerly milked for the
first time after calving over a <em>crossie-croon shilling</em> (<abbr title="Banffshire">Bnff.</abbr>) to
protect her from the evil eye, a talisman which would seem
to combine the efficacy both of silver and of the sign of the
cross. Many old brewers used to make with the finger the
sign of the cross on the surface of the malt in process of
fermentation; and the same sign is still made on the top of
the dough in the kneading-tub, though the origin of the
custom may be unknown to those who continue it in practice.
Herrick has put this charm into rhyme in his <cite>Hesperides</cite>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p class="cont">A writer in <cite>Longman’s Magazine</cite> in the year 1898 records,
as then extant, a west-country custom of placing a neatly
cut cross of birch wood over cottage doors, on the eve of
the 1st of May, to keep off the witches. The common
practice amongst market-women and hawkers of spitting for
luck on the first coin received in the day, is originally a
precautionary charm against witchcraft. It used to be said
in Somersetshire: Nif you do meet wi’ anybody wi’ a north
eye, spat dree times. To spit will avert the ill-luck consequent
on passing under a ladder. To make the sign of the
cross with spittle on the sole of the shoe was supposed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
cure the sensation of ‘pins and needles’ in the foot. We
have already noticed the action of spitting in connexion with
the ill-omened appearance of magpies.</p>

Protection against Witchcraft
</div>


<p class="new_para">Whilst silver was considered to be the efficacious metal for
missiles used against witches, iron and steel were held good
for protective charms. In Lincolnshire it was formerly the
custom to leave under the flag-stone at the entrance of an
outer door a hollow place, which was filled with broken bits
of iron, intended to keep off witches. It was necessary to
protect the stable as well as the house, and this was sometimes
done by hanging up implements made of steel or iron,
as was customary in the time of Herrick, <abbr title="compare">cp.</abbr> <cite><span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Charm for

<div class="sidenote">
The Horseshoe as a Talisman
</div>
<p class="cont">
More commonly, however, the horseshoe was the chosen
talisman. In some districts it was held that the horseshoe
was only efficacious if fastened up with the ends upwards;
but this seems not to have been an invariable rule. Many
people to-day, who firmly believe that to find a horseshoe
is lucky, will tell you that the luck will disappear into the
ground if the shoe is hung with the ends pointing downwards;
even positive ill-luck may thereby be drawn upon the house.
Others again lay no stress on the method of preserving the
charm. I recently questioned two natives of Berkshire on
this subject, and while one set firm faith in the importance
of fastening the shoe-ends upwards, the other was quite
content to see the charm ‘just slung up on a nail’. Even
better than the horseshoe as a charm to keep the witches out
of the stable was the <em>adder-stone</em> (<abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr> <abbr title="north Country">n.Cy.</abbr>), a perforated
stone, so called because the perforation was supposed to be
made by the sting of an adder; <em>hag-stone</em> (<abbr title="Lancashire">Lan.</abbr>); <em>holed-</em> (<abbr title="Northumberland">Nhb.</abbr>),
or <em>holey-stone</em> (<abbr title="north Country">n.Cy.</abbr>), <abbr title="compare">cp.</abbr><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span> ‘<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">to prevent the <em>ephialtes</em> or
night-mare, we hang up an hollow-stone in our stables</span>,’
<cite>Vulgar Errors</cite>, <abbr title="Book 5, Chapter 24">Book V, Chap. XXIV</abbr>. These holed stones
likewise protected the animals from diseases and the evil eye,
but they must be found already perforated, else they had no
efficacy. When in the course of time witches were forgotten,
superstitious minds still supposed these stones to have
peculiar virtues in propitiating luck. As <em>lucky stones</em>, they
were hung to the street door-key, for prosperity to the house
and its inmates, and we have already noted that, down to
modern times, anybody who picks one up considers it an
omen of luck.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
Use of Plants as Charms
</div>

<p class="new_para">Certain plants were reputed to be noisome to witches, and
hence effective as charms. For example: <em>cow-grass</em> (<abbr title="north Country">n.Cy.</abbr>),
the common purple clover; <em>dill</em>, the anet, for: Vervain and
dill Hinder witches of their will (<abbr title="Lincolnshire">Lin.</abbr>), an old couplet found
in Drayton; pimpernel; and <em>shady-night</em> (<abbr title="Lincolnshire">Lin.</abbr>) the nightshade,
are all good for preventing witchcraft. If a pig, for
instance, had been bewitched, a collar made of nightshade,
and put round the neck of the sufferer, would at once cure it.
A <em><abbr title="Saint" class="silent">St.</abbr> John’s nut</em> (<abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr>), that is two nuts growing together
on the same stalk, was formerly supposed to be a deadly
missile against witches. But most potent of all was the
mountain ash, the <em>quicken</em> or <em>wicken</em> (in <abbr title="general dialect">gen. dial.</abbr> use), or
<em>rowan-tree</em> (<abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr> <abbr title="Ireland">Irel.</abbr> <abbr title="north Country">n.Cy.</abbr>), for witches, it was said, have no
power where there is rowan-tree wood. Hence twigs of this
tree were fastened over doors of houses; they were tied to
the horns of cattle, and affixed to their stalls; cowherds and
carters had goads and whipstocks of quicken-wood, to
counteract the witch who could bring the team to a standstill,
whence the old sayings: Woe to the lad Without a rowan-tree
gad, and: If your whipstock’s made of rown You may
ride through any town. The churn-staff likewise was made
of this wood lest the cream might be bewitched and no
butter be forthcoming. Sprigs were nailed to the leaven-kits
to keep the witches out of the dough; and pieces of the
protective tree were carried in the bosom, or worn in the
pocket as a sure defence against all forms of witchcraft.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p>

<p class="new_para">The house-leek used to be planted on the thatched roofs of
cottages under the belief that it was a preservative against
thunder and lightning, and at the present time it is still
cherished as bringing good luck to the house upon the roof of
which it grows. A piece of hawthorn cut on Holy Thursday
protects a house from lightning, because: Under a thorn
Our Saviour was born (<abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr>). The slough of an adder hung
on the rafters is said to protect a house from fire (<abbr title="Cornwall">Cor.</abbr>).
Small tufts of dried seaweed, known as Lady’s Trees (<abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr>
<abbr title="Cornwall">Cor.</abbr>), were certainly as late as the year 1891 to be seen on
cottage chimney-pieces in fishing villages as a charm against
fire.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
Remedies for curing Diseases
</div>

<p class="new_para">By reason of the fact that many complaints were supposed
to be due to the malice of pixies, or witches, and to the
<em>overlooking</em> of malignant persons, we find many of the
remedies for curing diseases are closely connected with the
foregoing charms against witchcraft. For example, a flint
arrow-head was taken to be an <em>elf-shot</em>; if then a sick cow
was thought to have been <em>elf-shotten</em> with one of these
missiles, the proper remedy was to touch her with the arrow-head,
and then make her drink water in which it had been
dipped. The same idea no doubt underlies the following
remedy for <em>rewmatiz</em>: Take a thunderbolt, boil for some
hours, and then dispense the water to the diseased. Further,
we find the <em>quicken-wood</em> worn in the pocket as a charm
against rheumatism (<abbr title="Cornwall">Cor.</abbr>); and a double nut for preventing
toothache (<abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr>). Even among the home-made herb
medicines are some which partake of the nature of a charm.
The following, for example, is a recipe for allaying a fever:
Take a handful of dandelion, agrimony, verjuice, and rue;
mix with powdered crab’s eyes and claws, and some yarrow
gathered off a grave. Boil for some hours, and administer
when the moon is on the wane. Neither more nor less than
nine leaves of Adder’s tongue, <span class="sci_name">Sagittaria sagittifolia</span>, must be
picked to make the daily cupful of tea which is a good
strengthening medicine. Similarly, nine must be the number
of frogs you must catch for making the frog-soup which will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
cure whooping-cough. As, therefore, a hard and fast line
cannot be drawn between charms properly so called, and
semi-magic remedies, perhaps the readiest way to get a clear
survey of the various rustic methods of treating diseases and
other afflictions, will be to group them all under the names
of the different diseases. Although many of the superstitious
remedies here to be quoted are now no longer in use amongst
us, yet the ignorant superstition behind them is by no means
dead, even in towns where on every side are doctors, and
nurses, and chemists plying their trades according to the
latest and most approved methods. The <cite>Times</cite> of <abbr title="February">Feb.</abbr> 24,
1911, commenting on a Local Government Board Report,
the material for which had been furnished to the Department
by Medical Officers of Health, quoted the following
statement in reference to Ireland: ‘Disease-charmers and
bone-setters are very prevalent, and cause much suffering
and deformity.’ The <em>rag-wells</em> of Northumberland
and Yorkshire are said to be obsolete, but little more than
five years ago there were still to be seen hung round a
certain well in County Kerry, bits torn from the clothes of
people who believed that they had benefited from the
curative properties of the water. An instance of the old
practice of passing a child suffering from rupture through
the split trunk of a growing ash-tree was reported to me
from Devonshire last summer. Not many months ago my
gardener’s little girl on one occasion fell out of bed, and
grazed her back against a chair; by way of a remedy, she
was told to wet her finger with spittle, and apply it to the
wound. In October, 1910, a young friend of mine, then in
lodgings in Liverpool, had the misfortune to burn her hand.
Her landlady—who held a post as charwoman in a neighbouring
church, and who, as such, received gifts of old
church linen—offered to bind up the wound with a piece of
an old chalice veil; and she subsequently attributed the
quick healing of the burn to the efficacy of her ‘holy linen’.
About five or six years ago, in a country vicarage in the
Midlands, a girl I knew was nursing her brother in the last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
stages of consumption. Replying to some questions of
mine as to her duties as nurse, she told me that every day
she carried up from the kitchen two buckets filled with fresh
spring-water, and placed them under the patient’s bed, to
ward off bed-sores, because a lady friend, who ‘really knew’,
had said that this was a sure preventive. These are only
a few cases that have chanced to come within my own
knowledge, but no doubt numbers more could be found for
the seeking.</p>

Phrases denoting State of Health
</div>

<p class="new_para">Before passing on to a list of ailments and their cures, it
may be interesting first to look at some typical words and
phrases used by dialect-speakers in describing their state of
health. It may be assumed as a general axiom that a
woman never admits to being perfectly well. At most, she
makes a reluctant confession to good health by saying:
I’m pretty middlin’. This one word <em>middling</em>, by the aid
of a preceding adverb, and by due adjustment of the speaker’s
tone, may be made to express almost any degree of health.
<em>Middlin’</em>, <em>amongst the middlins</em>, or <em>joost middlin’</em> implies a
moderate state of health; <em>nobbut middlin’</em> means rather
poorly; and <em>very middlin’</em>, or <em>uncommon middlin’</em>, means
very ill: Sum daays ah’s middlin’, an uther sum as waffy

Homely Prescriptions
</div>

<p class="new_para">For maintaining good health and keeping the doctor out
of the house, there are in use certain homely prescriptions.
For example: Ait a happle avore gwain to bed, An’ you’ll
make the doctor beg his bread (<abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr>); or as the more popular
version runs: An apple a day Keeps the doctor away.
Sometimes onion is substituted for apple, or, according to an
Oxford version, the apple should be eaten during the day,
and an onion at night. There is an old west-country proverb
which bears further testimony to the health-giving properties
of the onion tribe: Eat leekes in Lide [March] and ramsins
[wild garlic] in May, And all the year after physitians may
play. The term <em>kitchen physic</em> (<abbr title="north Country">n.Cy.</abbr> <abbr title="Lincolnshire">Lin.</abbr> <abbr title="Somerset">Som.</abbr>), food, good
living, is found in early literature, <abbr title="compare">cp.</abbr><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span> ‘<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">The country people

<div class="sidenote">
Medicines for General Debility
</div>

<p class="new_para">Amongst the medicines for general debility are: a decoction
of dock-root, the common mallow, known as dock-root-tea
(<abbr title="Wiltshire">Wil.</abbr> <abbr title="Hampshire">Hmp.</abbr>), considered a great purifier of the blood;
old-man-tea (<abbr title="Cheshire">Chs.</abbr>), made from southernwood; bog-bean-tea
(<abbr title="Lakeland">Lakel.</abbr>), a grand thing fer takkin’ fur off yer teeth, an’
givin’ ye a stomach; medicines made from feverfew; gill-tea
(<abbr title="Warwickshire">War.</abbr>), a decoction of gill, i.e. ground ivy, heriff, and the
young shoots of nettles, given to children as a spring medicine
for nine successive days, a very bitter and horrible stuff. It
cannot, however, have been so nasty as a mixture formerly
known in Durham, called Dean and Chapter. This consisted
of the remnants from every medicine bottle in the
house, poured together, and well shaken, and then administered
to the patient whatever might be the nature of his
complaint. A common ironical saying used in recommending
a dose of anything specially nauseous is: Sup, Simon,
it’s excellent broth!</p>

<p class="new_para">To wash in May-dew was supposed to strengthen the joints
and muscles, the reason given being that the dew had in it
all the ‘nature’ of the spring herbs and grasses, and therefore
it must be wonderfully strengthening. But the more
general belief concerning May-dew was that to get up early
on May-morning and wash one’s face in the dew, ensured
a rosy complexion. A cosmetic for beautifying the complexion
by removing freckles used to be distilled from
<em>fevertory</em> (<abbr title="Wiltshire">Wil.</abbr>), the common fumitory, whence the old
couplet: If you wish to be pure and holy, Wash your face
with fevertory.</p>

Charms and Antidotes
</div>

<p class="new_para">For an Adder-bite: Apply the contents of two addled
goose-eggs; a poultice compounded of boiled onions and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
rotten eggs (<abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr>); garlic, the Churl’s Treacle (<abbr title="Cheshire">Chs.</abbr>), or
countryman’s antidote to the bite of venomous creatures.
As an amulet, a <em>milpreve</em> (<abbr title="Cornwall">Cor.</abbr>), or ball of coralline limestone,
may be worn; or it may be boiled in milk, and then the
milk administered to the patient as an antidote. To repeat
verses 1 and 2 of <cite><abbr title="Psalm">Ps.</abbr></cite> <abbr title="68">lxviii</abbr> was supposed to be efficacious
both as a protection from adders, and as a cure for their
bites. In an old <abbr title="manuscript">MS.</abbr> book, once the professional note-book
of a Cornish white witch, occurred the following prescription:
‘A charam for the bit of an ader. “Bradgty [spotted],
bradgty, bradgty, under the ashing leaf,” to be repeated
three times.’ For Ague: Take wood-lice, the species which
roll up on being touched, and swallow them as pills (<abbr title="Northamptonshire">Nhp.</abbr>);
or wrap a spider up in a cobweb, and swallow it like a pill
(<abbr title="Sussex">Sus.</abbr>); place a spider in a nutshell, and suspend it round
the neck in a small bag (<abbr title="Sussex">Sus.</abbr> <abbr title="Lancashire">Lan.</abbr>); ‘take the eare of a
mouse and bruise it, then take salte and stamp them together,
and make a pultas with vinegar, and so lay it to the wrists,’
<abbr title="manuscript">MS.</abbr> book of recipes, seventeenth century; write this charm
on a three-cornered piece of paper, and wear it round the
neck till it drops off: Ague, ague, I thee defy, Three days
shiver, Three days shake, Make me well for Jesus’ sake; pass
on the disease by means of this charm: I tie my hair to
the aspen-tree, Dither and shake instead of me (<abbr title="Lincolnshire">Lin.</abbr>). To
stop Bleeding: Apply pulverized selenite, called <em>staunch</em>
(<abbr title="Northamptonshire">Nhp.</abbr>), because it is supposed to possess the power of
stanching the bleeding of wounds; or spiders’ webs (<abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr>
<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr>); for cuts when shaving, use a <em>bull-fiest</em> (<abbr title="East Anglia">e.An.</abbr>), or
puff-ball; repeat <cite><abbr title="Ezekiel">Ezek.</abbr></cite> <abbr title="chapter 14 verse 6">xvi. 6</abbr> (<abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr> <abbr title="Cornwall">Cor.</abbr>); or this charm:
Christ was born in Bethlehem, baptized in the river of
Jordan, and as the waters stood still, so shall the blood stand
still in thee, A— B—. In the name of the Father, <abbr class="silent" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> (<abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr>
<abbr title="Cornwall">Cor.</abbr>). To cure Nose-bleeding: Take one or two large toads,
put in a cold oven, and increase the heat till the toads are
cooked to a crisp mass. Beat this to powder in a stone
mortar. Place the powder in a box, and use it as snuff
(<abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr>); tie the patient’s left garter round the family Bible,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
and put a key on the back of the neck (<abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr>); repeat nine
times these words: Blood abide in this vein as Christ abideth
in the Church, and hide in thee as Christ hideth from Himself
(<abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr>). For Boils: Take a quart of alder-tree berries, stew
in two or three quarts of water, and simmer down to three
pints, add liquorice to give a flavour. Dose: one wineglassful
every morning (<abbr title="Gloucestershire">Glo.</abbr>). Boils are also cured by creeping
on the hands and knees beneath a bramble which has grown
into the soil at both ends (<abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr> <abbr title="Cornwall">Cor.</abbr>). For Burns: Apply
goose-dung, mixed with the middle bark of an elder-tree, and
fried in May butter (<abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr>); repeat three times: Three wise
men came from the east, One brought fire, two carried frost.
Out fire! In frost! In the name of the Father, Son, and
Holy Ghost (<abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr> <abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr> <abbr title="Cornwall">Cor.</abbr>). For a Cold: Drink balm-tea
for a feverish cold, or <em>organ-tea</em> (<abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr> <abbr title="Cornwall">Cor.</abbr>), made from the
herb penny-royal, warranted to be specially efficacious
when sweetened with honey, and with a ‘drap of zomtheng
short in’t-’; take at bedtime a hot posset, made either with
buttermilk, or onions, or treacle; or <em>buttered-ale</em> (<abbr title="Northamptonshire">Nhp.</abbr> <abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr>)
made thus: Boil a pint of ale with a lump of butter in it,
beat up two eggs with sugar and spices, then pour the boiling
ale upon the eggs while stirring briskly. For a cough
<em>bramble-vinegar</em> [blackberry-] (<abbr title="Lincolnshire">Lin.</abbr>) is said to be an excellent
specific; and for a sore throat, let somebody read <cite><abbr title="Psalm">Ps.</abbr></cite> <abbr title="8">viii</abbr>
seven times for three mornings in succession over the
patient. For Colic: Stand on your head for a quarter of an
hour (<abbr title="Cornwall">Cor.</abbr>); mix equal quantities of elixir of toads and
powdered Turkey rhubarb. Dose: half a teaspoonful, taken
fasting, three successive mornings (<abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr>). Sloe gin is also to
be recommended. If the sufferer is an infant, administer
in small doses, <em>cinder-tea</em> (<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr> <abbr title="Lancashire">Lan.</abbr> <abbr title="Gloucestershire">Glo.</abbr> <abbr title="Oxfordshire">Oxf.</abbr>), that is,
sweetened water into which hot cinders have been dropped.
For Consumption: Take herb-medicines decocted from
lungwort (<abbr title="Hampshire">Hmp.</abbr>), the Jerusalem cowslip; or from <em>lungs of
oak</em> (<abbr title="Hampshire">Hmp.</abbr>), the hazel-crottles, <span class="sci_name">Sticta pulmonaria</span>; or from
nettles; and eat <em>muggons</em> (<abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr>), the mugwort, for as the old
rhyme says: If they wad drink nettles in March And eat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
muggons in May, Sae mony braw maidens Wadna gang to
the clay. Snail soup (<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr>), and broth made of the flesh
of an adder boiled with chicken (<abbr title="Lincolnshire">Lin.</abbr>) are also valuable
remedies. My old nurse remembers when she was a young
nursemaid, seeing her master, who was consumptive, swallow
baby frogs before breakfast by way of a cure for his complaint.
The treatment proved successful, for these reminiscences
had been called forth by a newspaper notice of the
gentleman’s death in 1910 at the age of eighty-eight! For
preventing Cramp: Wear eel-skin garters (<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr>), especially
recommended for use when bathing; when going to bed
place your shoes under the bed with the soles uppermost
(<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr>), or with the toes peeping outwards (<abbr title="Lancashire">Lan.</abbr>); or cross
your stockings and shoes (<abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr>); sleep with your stockings
on, and with a piece of sulphur in each; or go to bed with
the skin of a mole bound round your left thigh; carry in
your pocket, or in a little bag tied round your neck, a <em>cramp-bone</em>
(<abbr title="Durham">Dur.</abbr> <abbr title="Northamptonshire">Nhp.</abbr> <abbr title="East Anglia">e.An.</abbr> <abbr title="Somerset">Som.</abbr>), either the patella of a sheep or
lamb, or the top vertebra of a goose, but beware lest it
should fall to the ground, for if it touches the ground, its
virtue is lost. The real old historic talisman is, however,
the <em>cramp-ring</em> (<abbr title="north Country">n.Cy.</abbr> <abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr> <abbr title="Lincolnshire">Lin.</abbr>), a ring made out of the
handles of decayed coffins, and worn as a charm against
cramp. Formerly these rings were consecrated by the kings
of England, who were supposed to cure cramp, the ceremony
of the consecration being solemnly performed on Good
Friday. That this faith in the virtue of a ring is not yet
dead is shown by the following advertisement, taken from
a modern periodical: ‘We know our marvellous GALVANIC
Ring will cure you as it has done thousands of others, and
to prove this will send you one on receipt of <abbr title="1 shilling">1<em>s.</em></abbr> deposit....
Absolutely cures Rheumatism, Neuralgia, Lumbago, Sleeplessness,
Gout, Nervous Disorders, and kindred complaints.
They are also a certain cure for General Lassitude, no
matter from what cause arising. Worn by Royalty....
Why suffer? Delay is dangerous. Send for one of our
wonderful rings to-day and be cured.’ For Cuts: Apply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
a poultice made of comfrey. If the sufferer is a man, use
the red comfrey, and if a woman, the white variety (<abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr>);
or bind the wound with <em>cut-leaf</em> (<abbr title="Buckinghamshire">Bck.</abbr> <abbr title="Hampshire">Hmp.</abbr>), the <span class="sci_name">Valeriana
pyrenaica</span>, the upper side of the leaf next the skin for a cut,
and the under side for a gathering. For Diarrhoea: Take
a decoction of <em>slon-root</em> (<abbr title="Leicestershire">Lei.</abbr>), the root of the blackthorn;
or raspberry-leaf tea (<abbr title="Westmorland">Wm.</abbr>); or grate into milk or brandy
a biscuit or small piece of a loaf baked on Good Friday, and
kept throughout the year for this purpose (<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr> <abbr title="Worcestershire">Wor.</abbr> <abbr title="Sussex">Sus.</abbr>
<abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr>). Good Friday bread is also a specific for the same
complaint in calves. For Dropsy: Drink <em>besom-tea</em> (<abbr title="Somerset">Som.</abbr>),
an infusion of the leaves of the red heath broom; or try the
following recipe: Take several large fully-grown toads,
place them in a vessel in which they can be burned without
their ashes becoming mixed with any foreign matter. When
reduced to ashes, pound them in a stone mortar. Place the
ashes in a wide-mouthed jar, cork closely and keep in a dry
place. Dose. One teaspoonful of ashes in milk, to be taken
at the growing of the moon for nine mornings (<abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr>). For
Sore Eyes: Take a handful of the knobs called <em>pearls</em> (<abbr title="Ireland">Irel.</abbr>),
which grow at the base of button-grass stems, crush them
in a small quantity of water, and use the water as an eye-wash;
chickweed is also beneficial (<abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr>); bathe the eyes
with rain-water caught on Ascension Day (<abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr> <abbr title="Worcestershire">Wor.</abbr>); or
foment them with water in which club-moss has been boiled
(<abbr title="Cornwall">Cor.</abbr>), but this is only efficacious if the moss has been gathered
with all due ceremony. The day for cutting must be the
third day of the new moon, the hour must be sun-down, and
the operator, having first carefully washed his hands, must
kneel on the ground. The knife to be used must be shown
to the moon, and then the following words must be repeated:
As Christ heal’d the issue of blood, Do thou cut, what thou
cuttest, for good! When cut, the club-moss must be
wrapped in a white cloth, and afterwards boiled in water
from the spring nearest the place where it grew. If preferred,
the club-moss may be mixed with butter made from
the milk of a new cow, and applied as an ointment (<abbr title="west Country">w.Cy.</abbr>).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>For Fits: Drink an infusion of <em>herb-of-grace</em> (<abbr title="Lincolnshire">Lin.</abbr>), the rue;
go to the parish church at midnight on June 23, and walk
through each aisle, then crawl three times from north to
south under the Communion table exactly as the clock
strikes twelve (<abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr>); place the foot of a toad in a small
bag, and wear it suspended round the neck (<abbr title="Cornwall">Cor.</abbr>). As
a protective charm against fits the tongue of a still-born
calf, dried and worn in such a position that it touches the
spine, is effective (<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr>); or a ring made of a <em>sacrament
shilling</em> (<abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr>), which must be obtained thus: beg twelve
pennies from twelve young unmarried men, and exchange
them for a shilling from the offertory alms. In parts of
Yorkshire the <em>sacrament piece</em> was a half-crown, taken from
the Communion alms in exchange for thirty pennies collected
from thirty poor widows. The half-crown was then perforated
to allow of a ribbon being passed through it, and it
was worn round the neck as an amulet. For an attack of
Hiccup: Repeat the following: Hiccough, hiccough, gang
away, An’ cum ageean some udder day When aw brew an’
when aw beeake, An’ than aw’l mak’ a hiccough ceeake
(<abbr title="Lakeland">Lakel.</abbr>). For Measles: Give as a medicine a mixture
called <em>crooke</em> (<abbr title="Ireland">Irel.</abbr>), compounded of porter, sulphur, and
sheep’s dung; pass the patient three times round the body
of a live bear (<abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr>). To safeguard a child from the infection
of measles, place it on the back of a donkey, facing the
animal’s tail, pull three hairs from the tail, and hang them
in a bag round the child’s neck, and then walk the donkey
up and down a short distance, a thistle being held the whole
time over the child’s head (<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr>). For a Nettle-sting:
Rub the affected part with a dock-leaf, and say the while:
Nettle in, dock out, Dock in, nettle out, Nettle in, dock out,
Dock rub nettle out, repeating the charm rapidly till the
pain ceases. Other versions are: Nettle oot, dockan in;
Dockan, dockan, in, Nettle, nettle, out; Docken, docken,
inward, Nettle, nettle, outward; Dock go in, nettle come
out; Out ’ettle, in dock, Dock shall ha’ a new smock,
’Ettle zhant ha’ narrun [ne’er a one]. The use of this charm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
was evidently a common custom as far back as Chaucer’s
time, for he introduces the words as a phrase meaning first
one thing and then another, <abbr title="compare">cp.</abbr> ‘<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">But canstow pleyen raket,
to and fro, Netle in, dokke out, now this, now that, Pandare?</span>’
<cite><abbr title="Troilus and Creseyde">Troil. and Cres.</abbr></cite> <abbr title="Book 4 lines 460 and 461">Bk. IV, ll.&nbsp;460-1</abbr>. In this sense, the charm-formula
is found as a proverbial expression in North-country
dialects as late as the first half of the nineteenth century.
For Quinsy: Drink an infusion of <em>squinancy-berries</em> (<abbr title="Lancashire">Lan.</abbr>
<abbr title="Essex">Ess.</abbr>), black-currants, so called because of their special
efficacy in such cases, <abbr title="compare">cp.</abbr> <abbr title="Old French">O.Fr.</abbr> <em><span lang="fro" xml:lang="fro">squinancie</span></em>, quinsy. Once
upon a time there lived on the borders of Worcestershire
and Shropshire a wise man who worked cures, whose method
of treating quinsy was this: he made the patient sit bolt
upright in a chair, with a poached egg on the top of the head,
and a string of roasted onions round the neck, and then he
blew a mysterious powder down the poor victim’s throat
through a tobacco-pipe. For Rheumatism: Get a ha’porth
of mustard and boil it in a pint of beer; find a <em>dunderbolt</em>
(<abbr title="Cornwall">Cor.</abbr>), boil it in water for some hours, and then drink the
water, and it will prove a sovereign remedy. For external
application use <em>viper’s oil</em> (<abbr title="Norfolk">Nrf.</abbr>); or <em>marsh-mallows-tea</em> (<abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr>),
the latter is specially good for the ‘swellin’ as comes from
rheumatiz’. Charm-cures are: A potato, preferably a
stolen one, carried in the pocket (<abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr> <abbr title="Norfolk">Nrf.</abbr> <abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr> <abbr title="Cornwall">Cor.</abbr>); or
the shoulder-bone of a rabbit sewn up in brown paper (<abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr>);
or the right fore-foot of a hare (<abbr title="Northamptonshire">Nhp.</abbr>). A <em>sacramental
sixpence</em> (<abbr title="Cheshire">Chs.</abbr>); or a ring made of three nails taken from
three coffins out of three several churchyards (<abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr>), may be
worn as a protective talisman. A story is told of an old
woman who wanted to present herself for confirmation,
though it was known that she had been confirmed already
at least twice. When taxed with this she replied: Au knaws
au has, but au finds it good for the rheumatics. For Rickets:
Draw the child through a <em>holey-stone</em> (<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr>), a large upright
stone with a hole through it; or cause the child to undergo
the ceremony of <em>laying</em> (<abbr title="Banffshire">Bnff.</abbr> <abbr title="north-east Scotland">ne.Sc.</abbr>), as follows: the child
must be taken before sunrise to a smithy in which three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
men, bearing the same name, work. One of the smiths then
takes the child, first lays it in the water-trough of the smithy,
and then on the anvil. While lying on the anvil all the tools
are, one by one, passed over the child. It is then given back
to the mother, or nurse, who washes it once more in the
water-trough. In some places the water was first heated by
plunging pieces of hot iron into it, and the child was given
a little of the water to drink, besides being bathed in it, the
anvil part of the ceremony being omitted. In Northumberland,
a <em>heart-grown</em> child, i.e. one sickly and puny from a supposed
bewitchment, was subjected to a somewhat similar
process, but in this case it was important that the blacksmith
should be of the seventh generation in an unbroken
line of blacksmiths. The child was laid on the anvil, and the
blacksmith raised his hammer as if about to strike hot iron,
bringing it down gently to touch the child’s body. This was
repeated three times, after which the child was expected to
thrive without further trouble. For Sciatica: The following
charm was known in use as late as the end of the nineteenth
century: The patient must lie on his back on the bank of
a river or brook, with his head against the stream, and a
straight ashen staff between him and the water, and these
words must be repeated over him: Boneshave [sciatica]
right, Boneshave strite; As tha watter rins by tha stave, Zo
follow boneshave (<abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr>). For Shingles: Burn some barley
straw to powder, and put the ashes on the part affected; or
apply grease taken from the wheels of church bells, called
<em>dodment</em> (<abbr title="Worcestershire">Wor.</abbr>), or <em>bell-coom</em> (<abbr title="Bedfordshire">Bdf.</abbr>). This is said to be the
sovereign cure. In Shropshire, under the name of <em>bletch</em>, it is
an approved remedy for ring-worm. In parts of Lincolnshire
a name for shingles is <em>cat-jingles</em>, and children are warned
that they will contract it if they habitually nurse cats. For
Smallpox: Take a bun from the shop of a person whose wife
when she married did not change her name, be careful not
to pay for it, nor even say ‘thank you’, and then give it to
the patient to eat (<abbr title="Cheshire">Chs.</abbr>). For Sores: Apply crushed leaves
of the greater periwinkle; <em>cut-finger-leaf</em> (<abbr title="Wiltshire">Wil.</abbr>), all-heal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
<span class="sci_name">Valeriana officinalis</span>; the <em>vagabond’s friend</em> (<abbr title="Lakeland">Lakel.</abbr>), the
Solomon’s seal; <em>holy vervain</em>, <span class="sci_name">Verbena officinalis</span>. <em>Poor
Jan’s leaf</em> (<abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr>), the house-leek, also called <em>silgreen</em>, <em>singreen</em>
(<abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr> <abbr title="Oxfordshire">Oxf.</abbr> <abbr title="Dorset">Dor.</abbr>), pounded and mixed with cream is good as
a cooling ointment. <em>Featherfew</em> (<abbr title="Lincolnshire">Lin.</abbr>); and <em>goose-grass</em> (<abbr title="Huntingdonshire">Hnt.</abbr>),
the silver weed, are both recommended for allaying inflammation.
For Bad Legs a <em>cow-sharn</em> poultice (<abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr>) is considered
efficacious, and this is the recipe for making it:
Tak’ a ’antle o’ wutmil [handful of oatmeal], an’ as much
cow-sharn as’ll mix well together, an’ put it on the leg, it’ll
swage the swellin’ an’ mak’ it as cool as a cowcoomer [cucumber].
A <em>foal-sark</em> (<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr>), the membranous covering in which
a foal is born, when dried, is much valued as a remedy for
sores and skin-wounds. If you cut yourself, sticking the
knife into a flitch of bacon will prevent the wound taking
bad ways (<abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr>). A boy who had hurt his hand with a rusty
nail, was told by the Wise-man whom he consulted, to have
the nail first well filed and polished, and that then it must
be rubbed every morning before sunrise, and every evening
before sunset. By following these directions the wound was
cured (<abbr title="Northumberland">Nhb.</abbr>). For a wound caused by the prick of a thorn
the following is a Cornish charm: Christ was of a virgin
born, And he was pricked by a thorn, And it did never bell
[fester] nor swell, As I trust in Jesus this never will. For
Sprains: <em>crab-varjis</em> (<abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr>), the juice of the crab-apple, is
said to ‘swage the swellin’’ due to a sprain. An old Northumbrian
remedy was practised by the <em>stamp-strainer</em>, a
person skilled in the art of curing sprains by stamping on
them. The limb ought afterwards to be bound up with an
eel’s skin. For Stitch in the side: Use an application of
saliva (<abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr>), the common remedy for the painful sensation
known as ‘pins and needles’. For a Stye in the eye: Rub
it outwards from the nose with a wedding-ring (<abbr title="Somerset">Som.</abbr> <abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr>
<abbr title="Cornwall">Cor.</abbr>), some say this should be done exactly three times, some
say nine times; or it may be stroked nine times with a cat’s
tail, in which case, if the cat be a black tom-cat, the cure is
more certain. To draw out a Thorn: Apply the cast-off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
slough of a viper (<abbr title="Norfolk">Nrf.</abbr>). For Thrill in the foot: Make the
sign of the cross with your finger on the toe of your shoe
(<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr>). If the foot is ‘asleep’, make the sign of the cross
with spittle on the sole of the shoe (<abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr>). For Thrush:
Hold a live frog by one of its legs, and allow it to sprawl about
within the mouth of the child suffering from <em>frog</em>, or thrush
(<abbr title="Cheshire">Chs.</abbr> <abbr title="Lincolnshire">Lin.</abbr> <abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr>), the frog thereby will become the recipient
of the complaint. Take the child to a running stream, draw
a straw through its mouth, and repeat the verse, <cite>Psalm</cite> <abbr title="8 verse 2">viii. 2</abbr>:
‘<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained
strength because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still
the enemy and the avenger</span>’ (<abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr>); or take it, fasting, on
three successive mornings to have its mouth blown into by
a person who never knew his father, that is to say, a posthumous
child (<abbr title="Cornwall">Cor.</abbr>). A <em>left twin</em>, the survivor of two twins,
is thought to possess the power of curing thrush (<abbr title="Sussex">Sus.</abbr>).
Teething: A coral necklace round a baby’s throat will
ensure easy teething, <abbr title="compare">cp.</abbr> ‘<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Though coral doth properly
preserve and fasten the teeth in men, yet it is used in children
to make an easier passage for them: and for that intent is
worn about their neck</span>s,’ <cite>Vulgar Errors</cite>, <abbr title="Book 5, Chapter 24">Bk. V, Chap. XXIV</abbr>.
A necklace of beads cut from the root of henbane and placed
round the child’s neck is a Devonshire substitute for coral.
Some ten or twelve years ago I knew a baby that always
wore a mysterious black velvet band round its neck, which
the mother said was a certain preventive against teething
troubles, for all her children had worn a like talisman in
infancy, and no one of them had ever had any difficulty in
cutting its teeth. For Toothache: Take a decoction of
<em>elicompane</em> (<abbr title="Cheshire">Chs.</abbr>), the horse-heal; mix two quarts of rat’s
broth, one ounce of camphor, and one ounce of essence of
cloves. Dose: one teaspoonful three times a day (<abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr>);
steal some lead from the church roof or windows, and place
a pellet of it in the hollow of the decayed tooth (<abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr>); apply
a mustard plaster to the wrist (<abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr>). If you light on a briar-boss
[gall of the wild rose] accidental wen yo’ ’an the tuth-ache,
an’ wear it in yore boasom, it’ll cure it (<abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr>). To find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
a <em>loady-nut</em> (<abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr>), a double nut, is lucky, for it will cure
toothache; so does a tooth found in a churchyard, if rubbed
on the cheek over the aching spot (<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr>). A spider enclosed
in a nutshell, and worn in a bag hung round the neck (<abbr title="Worcestershire">Wor.</abbr>);
a dead person’s tooth carried in the left waistcoat pocket
(<abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr>); and the paw of a mole (<abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr>), are all good safeguards
against toothache. If you always put your left stocking and
shoe on first, it prevents toothache. If you cut your nails on
a Friday you will never have toothache, for, as tradition
tells, when <abbr title="Saint" class="silent">St.</abbr> Peter once complained of the toothache, our
Lord told him to cut his nails on a Friday, and he would be
cured. It is well to remember never to perform this task on
a Sunday, for: A man had better ne’er be born Than on the
Sabbath pare his horn. <abbr title="Saint" class="silent">St.</abbr> Peter seems to have been a kind
of patron saint of sufferers from toothache. An old toothache-charm
bearing reference to him was once common
throughout the country, as is testified by the various versions
of it which have been discovered by folklorists. The charm
had to be written out on paper, and worn on the person of
the sufferer, properly under a vest or stays. A Shropshire
version is as follows: ‘As Jesus passed through Jerusalem
He saw Peter standing at the gates and saith unto him,
“What aileth thee, Peter?” Peter saith, “Lord, I have the
toothache that I can neither walk, lie, nor stand.” He saith
unto him, “Follow Me, and thou shalt not have the toothache
any more.”’ In Somersetshire it ran: ‘Peter sat on
a marble stone, When by here Jesus came aloan, “Peter
what is it makes you for to quake?” “Lord Jesus, it is the
toothake.” “Rise, Peter, and be heled.”’ Scholars affirm
that the original of this charm is a Latin one found in the
Anglo-Saxon <em>Leechdoms</em>, beginning: ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Christus super marmoreum
sedebat; Petrus tristis ante eum stabat, manum
ad maxillum tenebat....</span>’ For Warts: Rub them with
<em>Devil’s milk</em> (<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr>), the great celandine, also called the
<em>wart-flower</em> (<abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr>), or <em>wart-wort</em> (<abbr title="Gloucestershire">Glo.</abbr> <abbr title="Wiltshire">Wil.</abbr>); or with <em>wart-grass</em>
(<abbr title="Cumberland">Cum.</abbr> <abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr> <abbr title="Derbyshire">Der.</abbr>), the sun-spurge, also called <em>wartweed</em>
(<abbr title="Cumberland">Cum.</abbr> <abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr> <abbr title="Gloucestershire">Glo.</abbr> <abbr title="East Anglia">e.An.</abbr>). These plants, and others which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
likewise contain a milky white sap, are the most popular
remedies for curing warts. Other applications are: <em>frog-spit</em>
(<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr>), the white froth deposited on plants by the insect
<span class="sci_name">Cicada spumaria</span>; the slime of a common snail (<abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr>);
fasting spittle (<abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr>); and eel’s blood (<abbr title="Northumberland">Nhb.</abbr>). It is a common
North-country belief that to wash the hands in water in
which eggs have been boiled will most certainly produce
warts. Dr. Christopher Wren, Dean of Windsor, and father
of the architect of <abbr title="Saint" class="silent">St.</abbr> Paul’s, in his marginal notes to Sir
Thomas Browne’s <cite>Vulgar Errors</cite>, makes the following
quotation from <span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Lord <abbr title="Saint" class="silent">St.</abbr> Alban’s ‘natural historye’</span>: ‘<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">The
taking away of warts, by rubbing them with somewhat that
afterwards is put to waste and consume, is a common
experiment; and I do apprehend it the rather because of
my own experience.... The English ambassador’s lady, who
was a woman far from superstition, told me one day, she
would help me away with my warts: whereupon she got
a piece of lard with the skin on, and rubbed the warts all
over with the fat side; and amongst the rest, that wart
which I had had from my childhood: then she nailed the
piece of lard, with the fat towards the sun, upon a post of
her chamber window, which was to the south. The success
was, that within five weeks’ space all the warts went quite
away: and that wart which I had so long endured, for
company.... They say the like is done by the rubbing of
warts with a green elder stick and then burying the stick to
rot in muck. It would be tried with corns and wens, and
such other excrescences.</span>’ This type of wart-cure was
formerly prevalent in very many parts of England. The
following are some of the best-known recipes: Take a large
black slug, or snail, rub it on the wart, and then impale the
creature on a thorn-bush, and leave it there to die and
wither away, simultaneously with the decaying of the snail
the wart will consume away and disappear; rub the wart
with the inside of the husk of a broad bean, and then throw
the husk away or bury it in some place disclosed to no one,
as the bean-husk rots, so will the warts; perform the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
ceremony with a piece of stolen meat or bacon; take as
many sprigs of elder as there are warts, with each sprig
touch a wart, saying: Here’s a wart, then touch a place
where there is no wart, and add: but here’s none, then bury
the sprigs; rub the warts with ears of wheat, an ear for
each wart, then throw away the ears of wheat to perish at
a ‘four-lane end’; make as many knots in a hair as there
are warts, and then throw it away; take as many stones
from a running stream as you have warts, fasten them
securely in a clean white bag, and throw them down on the
highway, then wash each wart in strong vinegar seven successive
mornings, and whoever picks up the bag of stones
will get the warts; wrap up in a parcel as many grains of
barley as there are warts, and lay it on a public road, whoever
finds and opens the parcel will inherit the warts; count the
warts over carefully to a passing tramp, and mark the
number inside his hat, when he leaves the neighbourhood,
the warts will also disappear; cut an apple in two, rub one
half on the wart and give it to a pig, and eat the other half
yourself; on the night of the new moon, let some one lead
the wart-patient out into the garden, facing that quarter of
the heavens where the moon is, the patient must then stoop
down and rub the warts with soil, returning immediately
afterwards to the house without once looking at the moon,
<abbr title="compare">cp.</abbr> ‘<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">referring unto sober examination what natural effects
can reasonably be expected ... when for warts we rub our
hands before the moon, or commit any maculated part unto
the touch of the dead</span>,’ <cite>Vulgar Errors</cite>, <abbr title="Book 5, Chapter 24">Bk. V, Chap. XXIV</abbr>;
repeat the words: Ashentree, ashentree, Pray buy these
warts of me, then stick a pin into the tree, and afterwards
into the wart, and then into the tree again, and leave it
there. The belief in remedies of this kind is apparently not
yet dead, to judge from a reference in a speech made last
July at a Conference on ‘The Revival of the Gifts of Healing
in the Church’. The speaker, Dr. A. T. Schofield, is reported
to have said that: ‘There could be no doubt that all disease
was partly caused and partly cured by mind. As proof that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
mental healing had power over the material diseases, he
might instance the wonderful power it had over the plebeian
affliction of warts.’ For Wens: Take a handkerchief which
has been wrapped round the swelling, and throw it into the
grave at the burial service of a person of the opposite sex
to that of the sufferer, as the handkerchief decays in the
earth, the wen will disappear. Formerly the approved cure
was the <em>dead-stroke</em> (<abbr title="Northamptonshire">Nhp.</abbr>), the stroking by the hand of
a person who had just been hanged, and numbers of people
used to congregate round the gallows at an execution in
order to receive this cure. For Whooping-cough, or as it is
termed in the dialects, Chin-cough, or Kink-cough: Administer
medicines made from the juice of <em>Robin-run-in-the-hedge</em>
(<abbr title="Ireland">Irel.</abbr>), the goose-grass, or cleavers, boiled with sugar;
<em>golden-locks</em> (<abbr title="Herefordshire">Hrf.</abbr>), the common polypody; <em>Robin Redbreast’s
cushion</em> (<abbr title="Sussex">Sus.</abbr>), the rose-gall, or bedeguar; or give wood-lice
as pills (<abbr title="Lincolnshire">Lin.</abbr>). Other remedies are: fried mice (<abbr title="Cheshire">Chs.</abbr> <abbr title="Norfolk">Nrf.</abbr>);
roast hedgehog (<abbr title="Cheshire">Chs.</abbr>); owl-broth (<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr>); a decoction made
from <em>pushlocks</em> (<abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr>), sheep’s droppings, also known as <em>lamb-trottle
tea</em> (<abbr title="Lincolnshire">Lin.</abbr>); a few hairs taken from the cross on a
donkey’s back, chopped up fine, and placed between two
slices of bread and butter, and given to the child to eat (<abbr title="Cheshire">Chs.</abbr>
<abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr>). Take a clean pocket-handkerchief and spread it
under the nose of a donkey, give the animal a piece of white
bread, take up the crumbs which fall, mix them with milk,
and give the mixture to the child to drink; make the child
eat its food with a <em>quick-horn</em> spoon (<abbr title="north-east Scotland">ne.Sc.</abbr>), that is, a spoon
made from the horn taken from a living animal. A woman
who has not changed her name in marriage can cure whooping-cough
by giving the patient something to eat, a cake,
or a piece of bread and butter (<abbr title="Cheshire">Chs.</abbr>). If the child is fed with
bread and butter from the table of a family the heads of
which bear the names of John and Joan, it is likewise
efficacious (<abbr title="Cornwall">Cor.</abbr>). In a certain district in Staffordshire
children suffering from whooping-cough were often sent to
an old couple whose names were Joseph and Mary in hopes
of a gift of food, which if neither asked for, nor thanked for,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
was regarded as an effective remedy. Any one riding
a piebald horse has the power to prescribe an infallible
remedy for whooping-cough (<abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr> <abbr title="north Country">n.Cy.</abbr> <abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr>), and cures are
said to have resulted from the simplest things, such as cold
water, honey, bread and butter, and tea, suggested by
riders in answer to the question: What is good for the chin-cough?
Another approved remedy was to pass the child
a certain number of times, usually nine, round the body of
a parti-coloured horse, a donkey, a white cow or mare (<abbr title="Cheshire">Chs.</abbr>
<abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr> <abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr>). A child that had ridden on a bear was believed
to be proof against ever taking the disease (<abbr title="Lancashire">Lan.</abbr>). The
bearward of former times subsisted largely on the moneys
given him by the parents of children that had ridden on the
bear as a protection against whooping-cough. Carry the
child into a sheep-fold, and let the sheep breathe on its face,
and then lay the child on the spot of ground from which
a sheep has just arisen, continue this daily for a week, and:
’Tes a zartin cure (<abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr>). Find a briar growing in the ground
at both ends, pass the child under and over it nine times, for
three successive mornings before sunrise, repeating: Under
the briar, and over the briar, I wish to leave the chin-cough
here; or pass the child six times under and over a bramble
rooted at both ends, round and round while saying the
Lord’s Prayer, then take half a dozen leaves from the spray,
and make tea of them, and give them to the child to drink
(<abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr>). This ceremony performed over a bramble which
grows in three counties is considered a still more potent
charm. In parts of Scotland children were sometimes put
through the hoppers of mills. Catch a frog, open its mouth,
let the patient cough into it three times, and then throw the
creature over his left shoulder, and the cough will disappear
at once (<abbr title="Cheshire">Chs.</abbr> <abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr> <abbr title="Worcestershire">Wor.</abbr>). Another way of transferring the
disease to a frog is to put the latter into a jug of water,
and make the patient cough into the jug, and this <em>smits</em>
[infects] the frog, and the patient is cured. A woman
relating how she had cured her child after this manner,
added: It went to my heart to hear the poor frog go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
coughing about the garden afterwards. The mountain-ash
also figures as a remedy for the chin-cough. A small lock of
hair must be cut from the head of the patient, and then placed
in a hole bored in the trunk of the tree, and fastened into it
with a plug (<abbr title="Cheshire">Chs.</abbr>). Or again, a certain number of <em>hodmidods</em>
[small snails] were passed through the hands of the patient
and then threaded on a string and suspended in the chimney;
as the <em>hodmidods</em> died, the cough would leave the child (<abbr title="Suffolk">Suf.</abbr>).
In Norfolk the mother of the sufferer would be told to find
a dark spider in her own house, and hold it over the head of
her child, repeating three times: Spider, as you waste away,
Whooping-cough no longer stay. The spider must then be
hung up in a bag over the mantelpiece, and when it has
dried up, the cough will be gone. Among curative charms
to be worn by the patient are: a hairy caterpillar, or a small
wood-lizard stitched up in a bag, and tied round the child’s
neck (<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr> <abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr>); some hairs from a donkey’s cross sewn up
in a strip of flannel, and worn round the throat (<abbr title="Cheshire">Chs.</abbr>); an
<em>adder-stone</em> (<abbr title="Lincolnshire">Lin.</abbr>), an ancient spindle-whorl, believed to be
produced by adders; a string with nine knots in it (<abbr title="Lancashire">Lan.</abbr>);
the small twigs of an elder growing in a churchyard, cut into
lengths of about an inch, and then threaded into a necklace;
a godmother’s stay-lace, or a godfather’s garter (<abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr>), worn
round the neck of a child suffering from whooping-cough.</p>

Supposed Powers of Healing
</div>

<p class="new_para">The seventh son of a family, born in succession without a
girl, was believed to be born with special aptness for the healing
art (<abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr> <abbr title="Somerset">Som.</abbr> <abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr>). An old man who died at Welshampton
about 1868, used to cure whooping-cough merely by contact
with the patient. Sometimes as many as ten or twelve children
were brought to him on one day. He always gave each child
a piece of cake before going away, but he never received any
money from any one for the cures he performed. He attributed
his powers solely to the fact that he was the seventh son of three
generations of seventh sons. In former days it was believed
that a seventh son could <em>strike</em> for the king’s evil (<abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr> <abbr title="Cornwall">Cor.</abbr>).</p>

The Water-caster
</div>

<p class="new_para">A mediciner much thought of in parts of Yorkshire was
the <em>water-caster</em>. Perhaps none of them are left now, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
certainly well within the memory of the present generation
a member of the profession lived in a village near Bradford,
where he was frequently consulted for all sorts of diseases
and bodily misfortunes. He pretended to be able to diagnose
the complaint from the <em>cast</em> or appearance of the urine, and
to prescribe accordingly. On one occasion he told a woman
that he had discovered by this means that her child, on
whose behalf she had come, had injured himself by falling
down some stairs. Whereupon the mother, at first unable
to trust this astounding perspicacity, put it to the test by
asking the number of the stairs the child had covered in his
fall. ‘Seven,’ replied the water-caster. ‘Your wreng,
Mester,’ said the mother, ‘it wor nine.’ ‘Then you didn’t
bring me all the water,’ was the calm rejoinder. ‘Your
reight, Mester, there, ah didn’t bring it all.’ So the woman
went away satisfied that the water-caster was a man of
infallible skill. In reality his marvellous insight was the
result of a very simple expedient. He was only to be seen
at certain stated times, hence he always had several patients
arriving at the same hour. He kept them waiting all
together whilst he himself remained behind a boarded
partition, where he was supposed to be occupied with his
scientific researches. Naturally the various sufferers detailed
their respective ills and symptoms to each other, whilst the
attentive water-caster secretly noted them down, to reproduce
afterwards with some simple medical advice in return
for pecuniary considerations.</p>

Charms against Cattle Disease
</div>

<p class="new_para">The best-known charm against cattle diseases in Scotland
and the north of England was the <em>need-fire</em>, a virgin flame
kindled by the friction of two pieces of wood. It was
formerly raised in one village and hurriedly carried on from
one village to another. A correspondent of <cite>The Times</cite>, in
an article on the Coronation Bonfires, June&nbsp;13, 1911, says:
‘These “need-fires” have continued in the north of England
within living memory. The writer has spoken with farmers
in Cumberland and Westmorland who in a time of cattle
plague have not only seen the “need-fire” carried from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
farm to farm, but cattle driven through the smoke to stop
the murrain.’ The word still remains in popular sayings,
such as: To be at a thing like need-fire, to do anything with
great effort or industry; to go like need-fire, to go with
great speed; to work for need-fire, to show great industry
or restless activity (<abbr title="Lakeland">Lakel.</abbr> <abbr title="Cumberland">Cum.</abbr> <abbr title="Westmorland">Wm.</abbr>). Another charm-cure
for cattle was the <em>shrew-ash</em> (<abbr title="Lancashire">Lan.</abbr> <abbr title="Sussex">Sus.</abbr> <abbr title="Hampshire">Hmp.</abbr>). The
affected part of the injured or diseased animal was rubbed
with leaves or twigs from an ash-tree in the trunk of which
live mice and shrews had been plugged up, and thus buried
alive. The <em>thunder-bolts</em>, and <em>awf-shots</em>, which we have
already noticed among charms against human ills, were also
used for the cure of disordered cattle. If an animal died of
distemper, a portion of its flesh cut out and hung in the
chimney would serve as a protection against a recurrence
of the complaint (<abbr title="Lancashire">Lan.</abbr>). For a <em>foul</em> (<abbr title="Cheshire">Chs.</abbr>), an inflammation
between the claws of a cow’s foot: Cut a sod on which the
diseased foot has stood, the shape of the foot, and stick it on
a bush. For Lameness in a horse, caused by a nail: Thrust
the nail into a piece of bacon, as it rusts, the wound will
heal (<abbr title="Worcestershire">Wor.</abbr>). The <em>quarter-ill</em> is a disease which specially
attacks young cattle, affecting them in one limb or quarter,
and usually ending in death. To prevent this, at the birth
of a calf, salt was sprinkled on its back, and an unbroken
egg thrust down its throat (<abbr title="Northumberland">Nhb.</abbr>). A piece of wood, termed
a <em>scopperil</em>, was sometimes put through the dewlap of a
beast, and an amulet suspended from it as a defence against
the quarter-ill. Another disease to which calves are subject
is called <em>speed</em> (<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr>), to prevent this, to nick the calf’s ears
before it had seen two Fridays was believed to be efficacious.
A Shropshire method of preventing a cow from fretting after
her calf when it is taken away from her, was to cut a lock of
hair from the calf’s tail and put it into the mother’s ear.
This keepsake was supposed to console her for the loss of her
offspring. Ef your dawg du lose ’is ’air, yiew mix up some
oil, gunpowder, and the ashes of an old shoe—that’ll make

Love Divination
</div>

<p class="new_para">The most prevalent of all the superstitious practices and
charms for divining future events are the ceremonies connected
with love-divination. Many of them are still in use,
secretly practised by the country maiden who is pining for
a sweetheart, or having one, doubts if he will prove constant;
or if she is so fortunate as to possess several admirers, she
wonders which to select, and seeks this aid to help her in her
choice. Fortune-telling by means of plants is mostly done
by children, and is indeed little more than a game. The
plant most commonly employed for this purpose is the rye-grass,
called <em>aye-no-bent</em> (<abbr title="Gloucestershire">Glo.</abbr>), <em>what’s your sweetheart</em> (<abbr title="Sussex">Sus.</abbr>),
and <em>tinker-tailor grass</em> (<abbr title="Somerset">Som.</abbr> <abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr>). The alternate seeds are
picked off one by one from the bottom upwards, to the
words: Tinker, tailor, soldier, sailor, Rich man, poor man,
beggarman, thief, each seed representing the occupation
named at the moment it is plucked. The list is repeated
over and over again till there is only one seed left standing
at the top, and this is the calling of the future husband of
the girl who is trying to read her fate. The same game is
also played with the leaves of the <em>pick-folly</em> (<abbr title="Northamptonshire">Nhp.</abbr>), the lady’s
smock, and with the fruit-stones left on a plate after eating
a helping of pie. The date of future marriage is foretold by
plucking off the petals of a field daisy one by one to the
words: This year, next year, sometime, never. In Shropshire,
children playing with a cowslip-ball toss it up and say:
Tissy-ball, tissy-ball, tell me true, How many years have
I to go through? Then, if they catch it as it comes down
they count it for a year, and so, on and on, as the ball is
tossed up and caught again. A love-divination game played

to me thus: write out your own name in full, and below
it the name of your chosen sweetheart. Then cross out every
letter of the alphabet common to both names, and count
over the remaining letters by repeating: Friendship, courtship,
marriage, through each name taken separately, and
the result will show the future relationship between the two.
Just lately, a young woman I know well was feeling thoroughly
depressed about her lover, for in spite of his long-standing
devotion, he yet seemed in no hurry to ‘get settled’; when
a friend of hers suggested putting the matter to the test of
this charm, which they used to work on their slates in school,
and exhibit over their shoulders to little boys behind, when
the teacher was not looking that way. Both names ran out
with ‘marriage’, and sure enough, within a very short time
the young man announced that he was looking out for
a cottage with a view to the wedding this autumn! The
common yarrow foretells constancy in courtship. Take one
of the serrated leaves of the plant, and with it tickle the
inside of the nostrils, repeating at the same time the following
lines: Yarroway, yarroway, bear a white blow, If my love
love me my nose will bleed now (<abbr title="East Anglia">e.An.</abbr>). If blood follows
this charm success in love is certain. Similarly apple-pips
may be consulted on this point. The name of the possible
lover must be whispered, or thought of in silence, and then
the pip placed in the fire, or on the hot bars of the grate, and
these lines repeated: If you love me, pop and fly, If you
hate me, burn and die. This is also done with nuts, and with
peas. In some parts of the country the ceremony is only
efficacious if performed on <abbr title="Saint" class="silent">St.</abbr> Mark’s Eve, April 24, or
Hallowe’en, <abbr title="October">Oct.</abbr> 31. Apple-pips are also used as a charm
to tell in what direction the future wife or husband lies. The
pips are pressed between the finger and thumb until they
fly, the following verse being repeated meanwhile: Pippin,
pippin, paradise, Tell me where my love lies; East, west,
north, south, Kirby, Kendal, Cockermouth (<abbr title="Lancashire">Lan.</abbr>). The
potency of the <em>even-ash</em>, i.e. an ash-leaf with an even number
of leaflets, shows itself thus; the young girl who finds one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
repeats the words: This even-ash I hold in my han’, The
first I meet is my true man. She then asks the first male
person she meets on the road what his Christian name is, and
this will be the name of her future husband (<abbr title="Ireland">Irel.</abbr> <abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr>). It
is considered as lucky to find an even-ash as to find a four-leaved
clover, for: Even-ash and four-leaved clover, See
your true love ere the day’s over (<abbr title="Northumberland">Nhb.</abbr> <abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr> <abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr> <abbr title="Cornwall">Cor.</abbr>). If
you find nine peas in a pod, and place the pod over the door,
the first person who comes in will bear the Christian name
of your future partner in life (<abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr> <abbr title="Kent">Ken.</abbr>), <abbr title="compare">cp.</abbr>:</p>

A future Husband’s Occupation revealed
</div>

<p class="cont">Then turn round three times, and cast the paring over your
left shoulder, and it will form the first letter of the future
husband’s surname. A form of this divination trick was to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
my knowledge practised by some of the kindergarten children
at the Oxford High School in 1910. A method whereby
Berkshire damsels of to-day seek to discover the name of
a future husband is this: Split open an unused envelope, and
write three names of young men you know, or would like to
know, one in each of three corners, leaving one corner a
blank. Place a piece of wedding-cake in the middle of the
envelope, and fasten it up firmly, and then lay it under your
pillow for three successive nights. Each morning tear off
a corner, and the name left on the fourth morning will be the
name of the destined husband, or if it is the blank corner
which remains, then you will die an old maid. The future
husband’s occupation may be revealed on New Year’s Eve
by pouring some melted lead into a glass of water, and
observing what form the drops assume. If they resemble
scissors, they point to a tailor; if they depict a hammer,
then they foretell a carpenter, and so on (<abbr title="Lancashire">Lan.</abbr>). Another
similar custom, belonging to Midsummer Day, is recorded
as known in Cornwall: Get a glass of water, throw into it
the white of a freshly-broken egg, and then put the glass to
stand in the sunshine. You will soon see by careful observation,
the ropes and yards of a vessel if your husband is to be
a sailor, or a plough and team if he is to be a farmer. If
when you first hear the cuckoo you take off your left shoe
and stocking, you will find inside the latter a hair of the
same colour as that of the person you will marry (<abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr>), <abbr title="compare">cp.</abbr>

me my true love this night, In his clothes and his array,
Which he weareth every day, and then place the onion
under your pillow; on All Saints’ Eve go into the garden
alone at midnight, and while the clock is striking twelve
pluck nine sage-leaves, one at every stroke up to the ninth,
when you will see the face of the future husband, or if not,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
you will see a coffin (<abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr>); gather twelve sage-leaves at noon,
keep them in a saucer till midnight, then drop them one by
one from your chamber window into the street, simultaneously
with each stroke of the hour, the future husband will then
either be seen, or else his step will be heard in the street
below (<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr>); on Midsummer Eve walk through the garden

Rites on the Eve of <abbr title="Saint" class="silent">St.</abbr> Agnes
</div>

<p class="cont">Get up at midnight on All Saints’ Eve and stand before
a looking-glass, combing your hair with one hand, and
eating an apple held in the other, and as the clock strikes
twelve you will see in the glass the face of the man you will
marry looking over your left shoulder (<abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr> <abbr title="Worcestershire">Wor.</abbr>). I can
remember a schoolfellow of mine performing this ceremony,
but in her case the prophecy proved a false one, for according
to her description, the chief feature of the man in the vision
was his moustache, and the man she ultimately married
had none, for he was a clean-shaven clergyman. Perhaps
the reason why the charm failed was because she had no
apple to eat! On the Eve of <abbr title="Saint" class="silent">St.</abbr> Mark (<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr>), or of <abbr title="Saint" class="silent">St.</abbr> Agnes,
Jan. 20 (<abbr title="Lancashire">Lan.</abbr>), place on the floor a lighted <em>pigtail</em>, a small
farthing candle, which must have been previously stolen, or
else the charm will not work. Then sit down in silence and
watch it till it begins to burn blue, when the future husband<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
will appear and walk across the room. The following is
a very simple plan: Spread bread and cheese on the table,
and sit down to it alone, observing strict silence. As the
clock strikes twelve your future lover will appear and join
you at your frugal meal (<abbr title="Cornwall">Cor.</abbr>).
On <abbr title="Saint" class="silent">St.</abbr> Agnes’ Fast, <abbr title="January">Jan.</abbr> 21,
you can procure a sight of your future husband thus: Eat
nothing all day till bedtime, then boil an egg hard, extract the
yolk, fill up the cavity with salt, and eat the egg, shell and
all, then walk backwards to bed, repeating these lines:
Sweet <abbr title="Saint" class="silent">St.</abbr> Agnes, work thy fast; If ever I be to marry man,
Or man be to marry me, I hope him this night to see (<abbr title="Northumberland">Nhb.</abbr>).
Some say that the same result may be effected by eating
a raw red herring, bones and all, before going to bed; or by
placing the shoes, on going to bed, at right angles to each
other in the shape of a T, saying the while: I place my
shoes in form of a T, Hoping my true love to see; Not
dressed in his best array, But in the clothes he wears every
day (<abbr title="Northumberland">Nhb.</abbr> <abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr>). Another more elaborate ceremony is the
preparation of the <em>dumb-cake</em> on <abbr title="Saint" class="silent">St.</abbr> Mark’s or sometimes
on <abbr title="Saint" class="silent">St.</abbr> Agnes’ Eve (<abbr title="north Country">n.Cy.</abbr> <abbr title="Northumberland">Nhb.</abbr> <abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr> <abbr title="Northamptonshire">Nhp.</abbr> <abbr title="Norfolk">Nrf.</abbr>); or, as in
Oxfordshire, on Christmas Eve, under the commonplace
name of <em>dough-cake</em>. The cake must be prepared fasting,
and in silence. When ready it must be placed in a pan on
the coals to bake, and at midnight the future husband will
come in, turn the cake, and go out again. In order to dream
of the future husband: on a Friday night, when you go to
bed, draw your left stocking into your right and say: This
is the blessed Friday night; I draw my left stocking into
my right, To dream of the living, not of the dead, To dream
of the young man I am to wed (<abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr>), then go to sleep
without uttering another word; read the verse: ‘<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Lay
down now, put me in a surety with thee; who is he that
will strike hands with me?</span>’ <cite>Job</cite> <abbr title="chapter 17 verse 3">xvii. 3</abbr>, after supper, then
wash up the supper dishes and go to bed without speaking
a word, placing the Bible under your pillow with a pin
stuck through the verse previously read (<abbr title="north-east Scotland">ne.Sc.</abbr>); or place
a Bible under your pillow with a crooked sixpence over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
verses: ‘<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave thee, or
return from following after thee....</span>’ <cite>Ruth</cite> <abbr title="chapter 1 verses 16 and 17">i. 16,&nbsp;17</abbr> (<abbr title="Lancashire">Lan.</abbr>);
take a blade-bone of mutton, stick it full of pins, go upstairs
to bed walking backwards, and place the bone under your
pillow (<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr>); get a piece of wedding-cake, carry it upstairs
backwards, tie it in your left stocking with your right garter,
place it under your pillow, and get into bed backwards,
keeping strict silence all the while (<abbr title="Cornwall">Cor.</abbr>). In its simplest
form of sleeping with what Addison calls ‘an handsome
slice of bride-cake ... placed very conveniently under’ the
pillow, this is perhaps the most widely practised of all the
dream-charms. Gather on a Friday at midnight nine leaves
of the she-holly, <span class="sci_name">Ilex aquifolium</span>, tie them with nine knots
inside a three-cornered handkerchief, and place them under
the pillow (<abbr title="Northumberland">Nhb.</abbr>). A way of finding out if you will ever be
married or not, is to go into the farmyard at night and tap
smartly at the door of the fowl-house. If a hen first cackles,
you will never marry, but if a cock crows first then you will
marry before the end of the coming year (<abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr>). The merry-thought
of a fowl is frequently used to ascertain which of
two young people will be the first to enter the married state.
In some places the shorter piece of the broken bone denotes
the nearer marriage, elsewhere the longer piece is the coveted
portion. In Northumberland <em>scadded</em> [scalded] peas were
formerly eaten out of a large bowl, and the person who
obtained the last pea was supposed to be the first married.</p>

<p class="new_para">Beside these ceremonies—of which the above are a mere
handful among the hosts of examples of this popular form
of divination which might be quoted—there are the more
serious and solemn practices for discovering approaching
death, such as <em>watching the kirk</em> on <abbr title="Saint" class="silent">St.</abbr> Mark’s Eve (<abbr title="Durham">Dur.</abbr> <abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr>).
The watcher took up his post at midnight in the church
porch, and between then and one o’clock he would see pass
into the church one by one the figures of all the persons in
the parish who would die within the coming year. According
to some, all the parishioners would be seen to defile into the
church, and then those destined to live through the year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
would pass out thence, while the doomed would remain
behind and never be seen again. Another <abbr title="Saint" class="silent">St.</abbr> Mark’s Eve
custom was the <em>caff-riddling</em> (<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr>), a mode of divination by
means of a <em>riddle</em> and chaff. The inquirer repaired at midnight
to the barn, and leaving the doors wide open, he there
riddled the contents of his sieve, and watched for portents.
If a funeral procession passed by, or shapes of men carrying
a coffin, then the watcher would die within a year, but if
nothing appeared he was destined to live. <abbr title="Saint" class="silent">St.</abbr> Mark’s Eve
was also the night for <em>ash-riddling</em> (<abbr title="north Country">n.Cy.</abbr>). The ashes were
riddled on the hearth, and left there untouched when the
family retired to rest, the idea being, that if any of the
inmates of the house were fated to die within the year, the
print of his or her shoe would be found impressed in the
soft ashes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
Divination to discover Theft
</div>

<p class="new_para">The ancient form of divination by ‘riddle and shears’ was
used for the discovery of theft. A sieve was held in a pair of
shears, whilst the names of suspected persons were uttered.
At the mention of the culprit’s name, the sieve was supposed
to turn round. Similar to this are the investigations made
with ‘Bible and key’, though the details of the performance
vary slightly in different parts of the country. In Devonshire
the trial was conducted thus: the name of the suspected
person was written on a piece of paper and placed within
the leaves of a Bible, together with the front-door key, the
wards of which must rest on the eighteenth verse of Psalm 1:
‘When thou sawest a thief, then thou consentedst with him.’
The left garters of two persons were then tied round the
Bible, and these two persons placed their right forefingers
under the bow of the key, repeating at the same time the
above-mentioned verse. If the Bible moved, the suspected
person was condemned as guilty, if it remained stationary,
he was adjudged innocent.</p>

<span class="sub_head">BIRTH, MARRIAGE, AND DEATH CUSTOMS</span></h2>

<p class="new_para">As might be expected, very many ancient superstitious
ideas have lingered round the three great events of man’s life—his
birth, marriage, and death. They took shape in
various customs which were handed down from one generation
to another long after the beliefs underlying them had
ceased to exist in the popular mind. But now the traditional
customs themselves are fast disappearing, whilst often their
original significance is a matter only to be explained by the
most learned folklorists. Here and there a new meaning
has been grafted on to an old practice, which makes the old
usage sound rational, and prolongs its life. For instance, in
some districts, the first food given to a newly-born baby is
a spoonful of butter and sugar, administered as wholesome,
and even necessary medicine; but according to scholars, the
practice was in origin a religious rite, belonging to remote
antiquity. Again, it is popularly regarded as unlucky to cut
a baby’s nails before it is a year old, because if this was done
the baby would most certainly grow up a thief. If the nails
need to be shortened, they must be bitten or pulled off. The
real reason why the baby’s fingers must not come in contact
with the scissors, is a fear respecting the baneful effect of
iron, which has its source in the Dark Ages of primitive man,
<abbr title="compare">cp.</abbr> ‘Professor Rhys believes aversion to iron to be a survival
of the feeling implanted in man’s early life, when all metals
were new, and hence to be avoided.... The same dread of
iron has doubtless given rise to the custom throughout
Europe regarding children’s nails. Everywhere, including
England, it is the practice to bite off the infant’s nails if
too long, and not to cut them, at least for the first year, or
until the child, who is peculiarly open to the attacks of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
malignant influences, has grown strong,’ F.T. Elworthy, <cite>The
Evil Eye</cite>, 1895, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 224. Further, Mr. Elworthy tells us that
the habit of covering up a new-born baby’s face whenever it
is taken out of the house, said to be a necessary protection
against the rigour of the outer air, may be referred to the
‘primaeval belief in the liability of infants to the blighting
effect of the stranger’s eye,’ <cite>The Evil Eye</cite>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 428.</p>

<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Heft</span> 3/4, June 1912. The cradle provided for the baby
must be paid for before it is brought into the house, else the
child that sleeps in it will die without means to pay for
a coffin (<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr>). Another curious superstition concerning
a cradle is that should any one rock an empty cradle another
baby will shortly come to occupy it (<abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr> <abbr title="Sussex">Sus.</abbr> <abbr title="Cornwall">Cor.</abbr>): Rock
the cradle empty, You’ll rock the babies plenty. When
possible, a new-born child before being laid beside the
mother was placed in the arms of a maiden. This was
thought to have a beneficial influence on the development
of its character. It is still held important that the first time
an infant leaves the mother’s room it should be taken <em>up</em>stairs,
not <em>down</em>. If there is no upper story, then the nurse
mounts upon a chair, or some other article of furniture, with
the baby in her arms; for if its first step in the world is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
a descent, then its subsequent career in life will be a downward
course. This custom was observed in the case of
a baby born a fortnight ago in Oxford, June&nbsp;3, 1912, in
a highly superior family. In Cumberland a child born on
a Friday was always placed on the Bible shortly after its
birth, no doubt with intent to secure it against the power of
fairies. We have already noticed some of the ceremonies
for warding off evil beings. One of these observances,
formerly in use in the north of Scotland, was to turn an
infant three times head over heels in the nurse’s arms, and
shake it three times head downwards, to keep off fairies.
Both in Scotland and in many parts of England a notion
prevailed that it was unlucky to wash the palms of a baby’s
hands, for if washed, they would never ‘gather riches’.
Sometimes this rule was observed till the baby was a year old.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
Feasts at the Birth of a Child
</div>

<p class="new_para">In some districts it is still the custom to provide a feast
on the occasion of the birth of a child for all the friends and
neighbours who come to assist or to congratulate. This
festive gathering is known under various names, for example:
the <em>bed-ale</em> (<abbr title="south-west Country">sw.Cy.</abbr>), the word <em>ale</em> being used in its old

wrongly applied to the liquor prepared for these occasions,
which, properly speaking, is the <em>groaning-drink</em>. The <em>blithe-meat</em>
(<abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr> <abbr title="Ireland">Irel.</abbr>), where amongst the viands was always
a cheese, called the <em>cryin’-oot cheese</em>; the <em>cummer-skolls</em>

made of oatmeal, milk, and sugar, and baked in a frying-pan,
and beside it the indispensable cheese, or <em>cryin’-kebback</em>, of
which each guest was expected to carry away a piece for
distribution among friends who were not present at the
entertainment; the <em>shout</em> (<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr>), to which the neighbours
were summoned at the moment when the birth was about
to take place, and to which they came each with a warming-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>pan.
After the event, they stayed to spend a festive hour,
when each guest was expected to favour the child with
a good wish. In more modern times this custom of celebrating
a birth by a convivial gathering is commonly spoken
of in northern England as: the head-washing, or: weshin’
t’bairn’s head, and is not so much a feast as a free drinking.</p>

<p class="new_para">The old north-country toast drunk at the birth-feast was:
The wife a good church-going and a battening to the bairn;
or: Here’s good battening to t’barn, and good mends to the
mother!</p>

<div class="sidenote">
Dainties belonging to Birth Feasts
</div>

<p class="new_para">The <em>groaning-cheese</em> seems to have been everywhere a
standing dish at the birth-feast. Formerly it was the
practice to cut it in the middle, and so by degrees form it
into a large kind of ring through which the child was drawn
on the day of the christening (<abbr title="north Country">n.Cy.</abbr> <abbr title="Oxfordshire">Oxf.</abbr>). A slice of it laid
under the pillow was supposed to enable a maiden to dream
of her lover. The remains of the cheese and cake were kept
for subsequent callers, and every visitor was expected to
taste them. A special Cumberland dainty belonging to
birth festivities is <em>run-butter</em>, or <em>rum-butter</em>, fresh butter
melted with brown sugar and rum, poured into china bowls,
where it stiffens, and out of which it is served, generally with
<em>havver</em> [oat] <em>breed</em>. The lady who first cuts into the bowl is
predicted to require a similar compliment. At one time it
was customary to hide the bowl of <em>rum-butter</em> and allow it
to be searched for by boys, who, having found it and eaten
its contents, made a collection of money, which was put by
for the baby in whose honour the delicacy had been made.</p>

<p class="new_para">A custom once common in nearly all the northern counties
of England—and still extant at the end of last century—was
that of presenting a new-born infant with three articles
‘for luck’, the first time it visited a neighbour or relation.
The gifts usually consisted of an egg, a handful of salt, and
a new sixpence, but sometimes a piece of bread, or a bunch
of matches was substituted for the coin. In Lancashire and
Yorkshire this ceremony was known as <em>puddinging</em>; in
Durham the gifts were termed: the bairn’s awmous, <abbr title="compare">cp.</abbr><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
<abbr title="Old Norse">O.N.</abbr> <em><span lang="non" xml:lang="non">almusa</span></em>, an alms. On the day of the christening somewhat
similar gifts were made by the parents on behalf of the
child. Before the procession started for church, a parcel was
made up containing a slice of the christening cake, some
cheese, and a packet of salt. This was called the <em>christening
bit</em> (<abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr> <abbr title="north Country">n.Cy.</abbr>), or <em>kimbly</em> (<abbr title="Cornwall">Cor.</abbr>). It was presented to the
first person met on the way to church, and it was considered
specially lucky if that person chanced to be of the opposite
sex to the infant. In parts of Scotland the receiver was
always the first male passer-by. He constituted the child’s
<em>first-foot</em>, and if he was a dark-haired man it augured well
for the child’s future, but if fair-haired, then the reverse.
After the church service came the christening feast at home,
with its special cakes, and dishes such as <em>butter-sops</em> (<abbr title="Cumberland">Cum.</abbr>
<abbr title="Westmorland">Wm.</abbr>), oatcake or wheaten bread fried in melted butter and
sugar. Then the child’s health would be drunk with some
such formula as the following: Wissin’ the company’s
gueede health, an’ grace and growin’ to the bairn (<abbr title="north-east Scotland">ne.Sc.</abbr>).</p>

<div class="sidenote">
Omens drawn from Baptismal Service
</div>

<p class="new_para">The ceremony of private baptism is never considered
equal to public baptism in church. A child baptized
privately is said to have been <em>half-baptized</em> (<abbr title="west Midlands">w.Midl.</abbr> <abbr title="Oxfordshire">Oxf.</abbr> <abbr title="Kent">Ken.</abbr>
<abbr title="Sussex">Sus.</abbr>), or <em>named</em> (<abbr title="East Anglia">e.An.</abbr>), e.g. He wasn’t ever christened, only
named. Indeed, the term <em>half-baptized</em> is sometimes used as
an epithet applied to persons of deficient intellect, equivalent
to half-baked. It is held lucky for the baby to cry during
some part of the baptismal service, the utterance of one good
yell being the most favourable omen. If a male and a female
infant are presented for baptism at the same time, the boy
must be baptized first, else he will grow up effeminate, and
play second fiddle to his wife; and the girl will become
masculine in face and mien (<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr>).</p>

Marriage Customs
</div>

<p class="new_para">Most of the rural wedding customs belong to the days
when, in accordance with the popular maxim: Better wed
over the mixen [dunghill] than over the moor, the bride’s old
home with her parents, and the new one she was to share
with her husband were both within walking distance of the
church where the wedding took place. Then all the neigh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>bours
were the friends of both bride and bridegroom, they
had all grown up together with the same local traditions,
and they all clung to the observance of the same ceremonies.
Now railways and bicycles, newspapers and cheap magazines,
have broken down the old order of things. The bridegroom’s
friends and relations are often complete strangers to the
bride’s kith and kin, their ways and beliefs are unknown to
each other. They cannot join together in some time-honoured
ceremonial when the newly-wedded pair enter
their future home; instead they wave hats and handkerchiefs
in the wake of a train or a motor which is carrying
the couple to a distant dwelling-place. The bride, too, has
up-to-date ideas. She wants to make a sensation like
Lady Dunfunkus Macgregor’s daughter, a description of
whose marriage she has just read in the <cite>Daily Mail</cite>, or like
Miss Gwendolen Fitzwilliam in the current number of the
<cite>Family Journal</cite>. Her dress and her doings, and all the
wedding festivities must as far as possible be modelled on
a fashionable pattern, till finally, modern conventionalities
and not ancient customs rule the day. Two or three years ago
the <cite>Weekly News</cite> of a very small town in Herefordshire was
sent to me in order that I might read therein an account of
a village wedding in which I was interested because I had
known the bride’s parents all my life. Her father was the
village blacksmith, and sexton of the parish, as his father,
and grandfather, and great-grandfather had been before
him. Here was described how the bride wore a ‘gown’, and
how her mother ‘held a reception in a marquee’, and how
the bride changed into her ‘travelling costume’, and how
‘the happy couple’ then ‘took their departure in a motor-car’,
to ‘spend the honeymoon’ somewhere at the seaside.
Indeed, from the newspaper report it might have been
a fashionable ‘Society’ wedding, except for one recorded
detail: in the list of wedding presents it appeared that the
bridegroom’s father had bestowed on the happy couple ‘a
pig’! I am glad to say that the young people did not
continue to live up to the style of their wedding, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
bride has since often spoken of the pig as the most valuable
of all their wedding presents, for within a year this exemplary
animal presented them with no less than twenty-eight
robust and healthy piglings!</p>

Names for publishing the Banns
</div>

<p class="new_para">The usual preliminaries to a wedding, namely, the giving
in of the banns of marriage, and the publishing of the same
in church, can be very variously expressed in dialect
speech, for example: to put in the cries (<abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr>), or t’spurrins
(<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr>), or the askings (<abbr title="Lancashire">Lan.</abbr>); or to put up the sibbritts
(<abbr title="Cheshire">Chs.</abbr> <abbr title="East Anglia">e.An.</abbr>), or sibberidge, <abbr title="compare">cp.</abbr> <abbr title="Old English">O.E.</abbr> <em><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">sibbrǣden</span></em>, relationship;
to be asked in church (<abbr title="general dialect">gen. dial.</abbr>); to be asked out (<abbr title="general dialect">gen. dial.</abbr>),
i.e. to have the banns published for the last time; to be
called in church (<abbr title="Lincolnshire">Lin.</abbr>), or called home (<abbr title="Wiltshire">Wil.</abbr> <abbr title="Dorset">Dor.</abbr>); to be
church-bawled (<abbr title="Sussex">Sus.</abbr>); to be prayed for (<abbr title="East Anglia">e.An.</abbr>); to be
shouted (<abbr title="Lancashire">Lan.</abbr>); to be spurred (<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr> <abbr title="Lancashire">Lan.</abbr> <abbr title="Derbyshire">Der.</abbr> <abbr title="Lincolnshire">Lin.</abbr> <abbr title="Wiltshire">Wil.</abbr>).
The word <em>spur</em> in this sense is from <abbr title="Old English">O.E.</abbr> <em><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">spyrian</span></em>, to investigate,
inquire into, but popular etymology has connected it
with the ordinary literary English substantive <em>spur</em>. Hence
the jocular remark when a person has been once asked in
church: Why, thoo’s gotten one spur on thee! In many
villages (<abbr title="Lincolnshire">Lin.</abbr> <abbr title="Huntingdonshire">Hnt.</abbr> <abbr title="Rutland">Rut.</abbr>) it is customary to ring what is
called the <em>Spur-peal</em>, either at the close of the morning
service, or in the evening of the Sunday when the banns are
published for the first time. Formerly in parts of Wiltshire
a man whose banns had been published for the first time was
said to have: vallen plump out o’ the pulpit laas’ Zunday,
and he was asked how his shoulder was, since it had been
put out o’ one side. Parallel to this is the remark: He’s
gotten broken-ribbed to-day (<abbr title="Lincolnshire">Lin.</abbr>); and further, there are
the expressions: to fall over the desk (<abbr title="west Country">w.Cy.</abbr>); and to be
thrown over the balk (<abbr title="north Country">n.Cy.</abbr>), <em>balk</em> here signifying the rood-beam
dividing the chancel of a church from the nave. If
after the banns have been published the marriage does not
take place, the deserted one is said to hang over the balk;
or, to be hung in the bell-ropes (<abbr title="Cheshire">Chs.</abbr> <abbr title="Derbyshire">Der.</abbr> <abbr title="Worcestershire">Wor.</abbr>). Tradition
in Sussex says that if a man goes to church to hear his banns
read, his children will be born deaf and dumb. If a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
withdraws his banns after they have been given in, his
projected marriage is spoken of as a <em>rue-bargain</em> (<abbr title="Lancashire">Lan.</abbr>).
Them at’s e’ a horry to wed gen’lins eats rew-pie afoore

saying: Marry in haste and repent at leisure. To get
married is: to tie a knot wi the tongue, at yan cannot louze
wi’ yan’s teeth (<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr> <abbr title="Northamptonshire">Nhp.</abbr>).</p>

<p class="new_para">Formerly in Scotland and the north of England it was not
uncommon for the wedding-guests to contribute either in
money or in kind to the expenses of the marriage entertainment.
Such a wedding was called a <em>bidden-wedding</em> (<abbr title="Cumberland">Cum.</abbr>
<abbr title="Westmorland">Wm.</abbr> <abbr title="Lancashire">Lan.</abbr>), <em>bride-wain</em> (<abbr title="north Country">n.Cy.</abbr>), or <em>penny-wedding</em> (<abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr>). In
Lancashire, when the couple to be married were of the very
poor, it was once customary for the friends to assemble on
the wedding-day, and build for them a house of clay and
wood, termed <em>post and petrel</em>; or <em>wattle and daub</em>. The
relations provided a few articles of necessary furniture, and
when the <em>clay bigging</em> was completed the day was concluded
with music and dancing.</p>

Something old, and something new, Something borrowed,
and something blue. The something borrowed should if
possible have been previously worn by a bride at her wedding.
In Devonshire a bride is supposed to further her chances of
prosperity by carrying with her to church a few sprigs of rue,
and of rosemary, and a little garlic in her pocket.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
Omens at Weddings
</div>

<p class="new_para">It is a very unlucky omen for a bride on her way to church
if a cat or a toad should meet her on the road; if a raven
should hover over her; or if a dog, a cat, or a hare should
run between her and the bridegroom; if the bridal procession
should encounter a funeral; or if a cripple should cross
their path. It is unlucky for a widow to be present at the
wedding (<abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr>); or for the clock to strike during the marriage
service (<abbr title="Worcestershire">Wor.</abbr>). When the ceremony is over, whichever of the
wedded pair steps first out of church will be ‘master’ in
the home (<abbr title="Berkshire">Brks.</abbr>). At a recent wedding near Oxford, the
bride’s mother-in-law stood waiting outside the church door
to watch for this important omen, and when she saw her
son step out first, she clapped her hands exultingly, greatly
to the discomfiture of the bride, who had heedlessly missed
her opportunity. In parts of Yorkshire the same superstition
is connected with the leaving of the bride’s old home after
the wedding-feast; whichever of the two then crosses the
threshold first, will be the leader in their future life together.
For unmarried members of the wedding party to rub against
the bride or bridegroom is considered lucky, as by so doing
they may hope to catch the infection of matrimony.</p>

<p class="new_para">Superstitious practices connected with the <em>first-foot</em>, such
as we have already noticed at christenings, are also to be
found as part of the old wedding ceremonies. In some
districts it was the bride herself, on her way to church, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
carried in her pocket a small parcel of bread and cheese to
give to the first woman or girl she might meet after leaving
the church (<abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr>); in others it was a friend who was sent on
in front of the wedding procession with the <em>kimbly</em> (<abbr title="Cornwall">Cor.</abbr>) to
be given to the first person met on the road to church. In
Scotland two people preceded the procession, one of whom
carried a bottle of whisky and a glass, and the other carried
the bread and cheese. A man on horseback or accompanied
by a horse and cart was considered the most lucky <em>first-foot</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
After the Wedding
</div>

<p class="new_para">In the north of England, after the marriage service was
over, the bride on leaving the church had to jump or be
lifted over the <em>parting-stool</em>, or <em>petting-stone</em> at the churchyard
gate, after which ceremony money was distributed by the
bridegroom. In n.Devon this custom takes the form of
<em>chaining the bride</em>. Young men stretch twisted bands of
hay, or pieces of rope decorated with ribbons and flowers,
across the gateway. Then the bridegroom scatters handfuls
of small coin, the chain is dropped whilst the holders scramble
for the money, and the bridal party is free to pursue its
way home. Money demanded and forcibly exacted at the
church gates from the bridegroom is known as <em>ball-money</em>
(<abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr> <abbr title="Northumberland">Nhb.</abbr> <abbr title="Cumberland">Cum.</abbr> <abbr title="Cheshire">Chs.</abbr>), so called because formerly the money
was applied to buying a football for the parish; <em>bride-shoe</em>
(<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr>); and <em>hen-silver</em> (<abbr title="Cumberland">Cum.</abbr> <abbr title="Westmorland">Wm.</abbr> <abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr> <abbr title="Lancashire">Lan.</abbr>). Sometimes,
however, the <em>hen-brass</em> is money privately given by the
bridegroom on the evening after the marriage to enable his
friends to drink his health. In Westmorland a gun used to
be fired over the house of a newly-married couple, and the
<em>hen-silver</em> was the present of money given to the firing party
to drink to the future health and good luck of the pair.
A wedding at which no <em>ball-money</em> is distributed is contemptuously
termed a <em>buttermilk wedding</em> (<abbr title="Cheshire">Chs.</abbr>). On the
way home from church the bridegroom usually threw
coppers to be scrambled for by the children in the crowd;
guns loaded with feathers were fired as a sign of rejoicing
(<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr>); and friends came out to meet the bridal party
bearing pots of warm ale sweetened and spiced, known as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
<em>hot pots</em> (<abbr title="north Country">n.Cy.</abbr>). In Cheshire it is still customary to ornament
the approach to the bride’s home with sand spread in
patterns. The patterns are made by trickling silver sand
through the fingers, or through a large funnel. Wreaths and
floral emblems are thus traced out, and sometimes mottoes
are written, such as: Long may they live and happy may
they be; Blest with contentment to all eternity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
Wedding Sports
</div>

<p class="new_para">Among the ancient wedding sports was the <em>riding for the
kail</em> (<abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr> <abbr title="north Country">n.Cy.</abbr>), which took place when the bride was on her
way home. When the party was nearing the future home
of the couple, the unmarried men set off to ride or run at
full speed to the house, and whoever reached it first was
said to <em>win the kail</em>, or <em>keal</em>. The idea was that the winner
of the <em>kail</em> would be the first to enter the married state, <em>kail</em>
being the same word as <em>cale</em>, a turn in rotation. Some of the
accounts of this sport would however seem to show that
in some places the <em>kail</em> meant a dish of spiced broth given as
a prize to the winner of the race. The race for the bride’s
garter (<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr>) was formerly a very popular wedding sport,
and it continued in practice as late as the last decade of the
nineteenth century. The race was run from the churchyard
gate to the <em>bride-door</em>, where the winner claimed the privilege
of removing the prize himself as the bride crossed the threshold
of her home. It was valued as a potent love-charm, and was
given by the winner to his sweetheart: to binnd his luv.
Later a ribbon or a handkerchief was substituted for the
bridal garter (<abbr title="Durham">Dur.</abbr> <abbr title="Cumberland">Cum.</abbr> <abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr>).</p>

<p class="new_para">The ceremony of <em>throwing the bride-cake</em> existed in various
forms in Scotland and the northern counties of England.
When the bride returned from church, she was met on the
doorstep and presented with a thin currant cake on a plate,
or it might be shortbread or oat-cake. Some of this cake was
then thrown over her head, or more commonly it was broken
over her head by the bridegroom. In cases where the cake
was thrown over the bride’s head, the plate was not infrequently
thrown along with it. In Scotland the cake provided
was known as the <em>infar-cake</em>, <abbr title="compare">cp.</abbr> <abbr title="Old English">O.E.</abbr> <em><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">infær</span></em>, an entrance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
The custom is not yet extinct in Scotland, for I was told by
an eye-witness that at a fashionable Scotch wedding only
two or three years ago, the bride’s mother-in-law broke a cake
of shortbread over the bride’s head on her return from
church. The following is a Yorkshire rhyme which accompanies
the usual throwing of slippers after a newly-married

Riding the Stang
</div>

<p class="new_para">In olden days, when a marriage resulted in conjugal
infelicity, and the husband became a wife-beater, popular
disapproval was expressed by a method of punishing the
offender known as Riding the Stang. This custom with
slight variations and under different names—such as:
Rantipole-riding, Skimmington-riding, or simply Riding—was
once common practically throughout England, and in
many parts of Scotland. Cases where it has been kept up
in practice have been recorded as late as the year 1896. The
delinquent was caught and tied fast to a <em>stang</em> or pole, and
carried round the village in the midst of a jeering crowd; or
he was represented by a straw effigy borne on a ladder, or
drawn in a cart for three successive nights, accompanied by
horn-blowing and shouting. When the procession reached
the man’s house, a long <em>nominy</em> or doggerel recounting his
offences was recited, the verses varying in different localities.
A Lincolnshire <em>nominy</em> runs: He banged her wi’ stick, He
banged her wi’ steän, He teeak op his naefe [fist], An’ he
knocked her doon. With a ran, tan, tan, <abbr class="silent" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> On the third
night the effigy was burned in the street or on the village
green. Sometimes instead of an effigy, two men, one of
them dressed in female attire, rode in the cart, giving a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
dialogue representation of the quarrel, and an imitation of
the final beating. In some places the culprit was merely
serenaded with rough singing, and the noise of beating on
pots and pans. This ceremony was called Randanning, or
Rough Music, and is closely allied to Stang-riding, <abbr title="compare">cp.</abbr>

Death Superstitions
</div>

<p class="new_para">According to a popular superstition once prevalent in
many parts of England, dying persons could not pass away
peacefully if there were any feathers of game-birds or
pigeons in the bed on which they lay. Instances have been
recorded where some such feathers have been placed in a
small bag, and thrust under the pillow of a dying man to
hold him in life until the arrival of some expected relation;
and further, instances where, out of pure kindness, a sufferer
at the point of death has been removed from his bed, and
laid on the floor to die ‘nat’rally’. Formerly, when the
moment of death was unmistakably nigh at hand, it was
customary to throw open all the doors and windows, so
that nothing should hinder the flight of the departing spirit.
I myself can remember what seemed to be a remnant of
this superstitious observance in a country parish in Herefordshire
about twenty-five years ago. The widow of an old
farmer had just died, and her daughter told my father that
it was well that there was a bolt to the front door, for that the
key must not be turned in the lock whilst the body lay in
the house. This we took to be a preservation of the letter
of the old law. In Yorkshire there exists an idea that the
door must not be locked for seven years after a death in the
house.</p>

Death Customs

room was extinguished, and the looking-glass either covered

a piece of iron used to be thrust into all the eatables in
the house, butter, cheese, meat, <abbr class="silent" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, in order—as it was said—to
prevent death from entering them. When the corpse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
had been duly laid out, or <em>streeked</em> (<abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr> <abbr title="north Country">n.Cy.</abbr>), a plate of salt
was placed on the breast (<abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr> <abbr title="Northumberland">Nhb.</abbr> <abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr> <abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr>), formerly with
the avowed object of driving evil spirits away, but towards
the latter end of the nineteenth century, where the custom
was still in use, the reason given was that: it prevents the
body from swelling. This placing of a plate of salt on the
corpse had been part of the performances of the old <em>sin-eater</em>
(<abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr> <abbr title="Herefordshire">Hrf.</abbr> <abbr title="Carmarthenshire">Cth.</abbr>), a person who was called in when any one
died, to eat the sins of the deceased. He placed a plate of
salt and a plate of bread on the breast of the corpse, and
muttered certain incantations, after which he ate the contents
of the plates, thereby taking upon himself the sins of the
dead person, which would otherwise have kept his ghost
hovering round his relations on earth. In Northumberland
it was customary to double the thumbs of the deceased
within the hand, to avert evil spirits. The candles kept
burning round the corpse were termed in parts of Lincolnshire
<em>ghost-candles</em>, because they were supposed to ward off
ghosts.</p>

<p class="new_para">The customs connected with the tolling of the Passing Bell
vary somewhat in detail in different localities, but they are
substantially the same. After the bell has tolled for some
minutes there is a pause, and then follow the <em>tellers</em>, thrice
three successive strokes for a man, twice three for a woman,
and three strokes for a child. It has been suggested that the
old saying: nine tailors make a man, is a corruption of
nine tellers mark a man.</p>

<p class="new_para">The ceremony of holding watch over the dead between
the time of death and burial was called the <em>wake</em> or <em>lyke-wake</em>
in Ireland, Scotland, and the north of England. The
relatives and neighbours of the deceased assembled at the
house, and spent the night in the room with the corpse,
singing Psalms and dirges, chatting, telling stories, praising
the virtues of the departed, eating and drinking. This
gathering usually took place either the evening after the
death, or the night before the funeral.</p>

<p class="new_para">In due course somebody went round to invite friends and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
neighbours to be present at the funeral. This was called
<em>bidding</em> (<abbr title="north Country">n.Cy.</abbr> <abbr title="Staffordshire">Stf.</abbr> <abbr title="Derbyshire">Der.</abbr>), <em>lathing</em> (<abbr title="north Country">n.Cy.</abbr>), or <em>sperring</em> (<abbr title="Lancashire">Lan.</abbr>),
terms which are still in use—e.g. Awm gooin’ a sperrin’,
He’s gone a laithin’ o’ th’neeburs to th’berrin’, Ah mun gan
an’ see t’last on him, ah’s bid—though the custom of sending
a <em>bidder</em> wearing a black silk scarf has long been discontinued.
In many places in the Lake district, two persons from every
house within a prescribed area were invited to the funeral.
Formerly the <em>bidder</em> presented a sprig of rosemary to each
invited guest, and the latter was expected to carry it with
him to the funeral (<abbr title="Lancashire">Lan.</abbr>). In Shropshire these sprigs were
distributed to the mourners just before the procession left
the house. At the conclusion of the burial service each
mourner cast his rosemary into the open grave. In <abbr title="south Pembrokeshire">s.Pembrokeshire</abbr>
a woman walked in front of the funeral procession
strewing sprigs of rosemary and box along the road—‘There’s
rosemary, that’s for remembrance.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">
Funeral Cakes
</div>

<p class="new_para">A custom still practised in Yorkshire and formerly
prevalent in many other English counties, and also in parts
of Wales, is that of distributing <em>burying biscuits</em>, or <em>funeral
cakes</em>, small oblong sponge biscuits, which some think were
originally intended to represent a coffin. As each mourner
arrives, he or she is presented with a biscuit and a memorial
card. Sometimes this is done by two women who are called
<em>servers</em> (<abbr title="north Yorkshire">n.Yks.</abbr>). In the Midlands the biscuits were folded up
each in white paper sealed with black wax, and so handed
round to every guest; in this form, too, they were sent out
to any relations or intimate friends not present at the
funeral, just as wedding-cake is sent now. Two generations
ago this practice was commonly observed in middle class
families, as well as among the poorer folk. When my great-uncle—a
well-known Evangelical clergyman in Birmingham—died
some twenty-five years ago, his executors found
among his papers a packet, yellow with age, containing what
had once been a funeral sponge biscuit. Together with the
<em>funeral cakes</em> spiced ale used sometimes to be served, in
a tankard of silver or pewter; but in later, more degenerate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
days glasses of spirits and water replaced the tankard of ale.
Meanwhile the coffin was still kept open, that one and all
might take a last look at the corpse before the time came for
<em>lifting</em> (<abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr> <abbr title="north Country">n.Cy.</abbr>), when the coffin must be closed. Formerly
in Northumberland the <em>lifting</em> of the corpse was the signal for
the outburst of lamentation known as <em>keening</em> (<abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr> <abbr title="Ireland">Irel.</abbr> <abbr title="Northumberland">Nhb.</abbr>),
a dismal concerted cry raised by the assembled mourners.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
Funeral Rites
</div>

<p class="new_para">It is still a custom in some Midland counties for little girls
in white dresses and black sashes to act as bearers at the
funeral of an infant or very young child of their own sex,
and for boys to carry baby boys. The coffin is supported by
white handkerchiefs or towels passed underneath and held
on each side by the young bearers. The <em>funeral garland</em>
(<abbr title="north Country">n.Cy.</abbr> <abbr title="Derbyshire">Der.</abbr> <abbr title="Lincolnshire">Lin.</abbr> <abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr> <abbr title="Hampshire">Hmp.</abbr>), which marked the burial of
a young unmarried woman, has now long since become
obsolete. This <em>garland</em> consisted of a coronal or wreath of
ribbons, or flowers cut out in white paper, with a white glove
suspended in the centre, and it was borne in front of the
coffin, or upon it, to the grave, and afterwards suspended in
the church. According to a popular belief the passage of
a funeral over any ground establishes a right of way. Rain
at a funeral is a good sign, for: Happy is the corpse that the
rain rains on.</p>

<p class="new_para">A beautiful old custom, well known in Shropshire in olden
days, and kept up certainly within living memory, is that of
<em>ringing the dead home</em>. When the funeral procession came in
sight of the church, the bell ceased tolling, and a peal was
rung, as if to welcome the body to its last resting-place.</p>

<p class="new_para">There is a general feeling in country parishes against
burial on the north side of the church. The south side is
considered the holiest portion of the churchyard, where the
cross stands, if such there be. In a small parish, where there
are few interments, the north side of the churchyard may be
quite empty. This points the moral contained in the phrase:
Thaay bury them as kills thersens wi’ hard wark o’ th’no’th
side o’ th’chech, applied to persons who complain unwarrantably
of hard work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span></p>

<p class="new_para">After the burial came the funeral feast held in the house
where the deceased had lived, or provided at the village inn.
In some places if the family was poor, it would be a <em>pay-berring</em>
(<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr>), and each of the invited guests would give
some small contribution towards the expenses. To provide
a handsome entertainment on these occasions was looked
upon as a mark of fitting respect for the dead: Ah’ve nivver
been at sike a sitting-doon i’ mah leyfe; ther war nowt bud
tea-cakes, an’ badly buttered at that. Noo ah’ve sahded
fahve o’ my awn, bud thank the Lord, ah buried ’em all wi’
ham. It is on record that at the funeral of a farmer who
died near Whitby in 1760, meat and drink were provided as
follows: ‘110 dozen penny loaves, 9 large hams, 8 legs of
veal, 20 stone of beef (14 lbs. to the stone), 16 stone of
mutton, 15 stone of Cheshire cheese, and 30 ankers of ale;
besides what was distributed to 1,000 poor people who had 6<em>d.</em>
each in money.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">
Telling the Bees
</div>

<p class="new_para">One of the most interesting of all the ceremonies connected
with funerals is the superstitious practice known as <em>telling
the bees</em>, once common throughout the greater part of England.
To <em>tell the bees</em> is to inform them of the occurrence of the
death of the head of the house, or of some member of the
family. If this is not done, they are supposed to leave their
hives and never return, or else they all die. The right time
for making the communication is either just before the
funeral leaves the house, or else at the moment when the
procession is starting. On the Welsh Border people say it
must be made in the middle of the night. The form of words
used varies in different parts of the country, but they must
always be whispered words, or the bees may take offence.
These are some of the recognized formulae: The master is
dead; Your friend’s gone; The poor maister’s dead, but
yo mun work fur me; Bees, bees, bees, your master is dead,
and you must work for ——, naming the future owner.
This is accompanied in some instances by three taps on the
hive. The hives are ‘put into mourning’ by attaching to
them a piece of black crape. In some places it was customary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
to give the bees a piece of funeral cake; and elsewhere, small
portions of every item of the funeral feast were collected in
a saucer and put in front of the hive. In Devonshire the
popular belief was that if the bees were not told of the death
in the family, some other member of the household would
die before the expiration of the year. A writer in <cite>Lloyd’s
Weekly News</cite>, July&nbsp;3, 1910, speaks of the superstition of
telling the bees as still extant; and at about the same date
a girl in Oxford told me that an uncle of hers—yet living—had
lost all his bees by neglecting to tell them of the death of
his mother.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
A Month’s Mind
</div>

<p class="new_para">In some districts is found the observance of the <em>month’s
end</em> (<abbr title="Herefordshire">Hrf.</abbr> <abbr title="west Country">w.Cy.</abbr> Wales), a certain Sunday after the funeral
when the mourners attend church. A trace of an old
religious custom belonging also to the days subsequent to the
funeral has been crystallized in the phrase: to have a
month’s mind to anything (<abbr title="Cheshire">Chs.</abbr> <abbr title="Midlands">Midl.</abbr> <abbr title="East Anglia">e.An.</abbr> <abbr title="Isle of Wight">I.W.</abbr> <abbr title="Somerset">Som.</abbr> <abbr title="Cornwall">Cor.</abbr>).
This alludes to a pre-Reformation practice of repeating one
or more masses at the end of a month after death for the
repose of a departed soul. In the Churchwardens’ accounts
of Abingdon, Berkshire, occurs the following, among other
similar entries: ‘<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">1556. Receyved att the buryall and

<span class="sub_head">CUSTOMS CONNECTED WITH CERTAIN DAYS AND SEASONS</span></h2>

<p class="new_para">Beside the customs connected with the changes and
chances of man’s mortal life, which we have considered in
the foregoing chapter, there are those which belong to
certain fixed days of the year, Saints’ Days, and other
church seasons and festivals. To give an account of each
and all of the customs and pastimes which would come under
this category would indeed be a tremendous task, so great
is their number, and so varied their nature. I shall only
attempt here to give a small selection, arranged according
to the sequence of the dates to which they belong.</p>

<p class="new_para">We are all of us familiar with the usual ceremonies which
usher in the New Year—the sitting up to watch the Old Year
out and the New Year in, the ringing of the church bells
immediately after the last stroke of twelve, the handshaking,
and exchange of greetings. But in England
generally, New Year’s Day is of little account as a festival,
being overshadowed by Christmas. In Scotland, on the
other hand, New Year’s Day holds the more important
place, and consequently New Year’s Eve, as a day of preparatory
observances, ranks above Christmas Eve. New Year’s
Eve in Scotland is known as <em>Hogmanay</em>, a term which is
also applied to the customary gift for which children go
round and beg on this day. The name and the custom are
not, however, confined to Scotland, being also found in
certain of the northern counties of England (<abbr title="Northumberland">Nhb.</abbr> <abbr title="Cumberland">Cum.</abbr> <abbr title="Westmorland">Wm.</abbr>
<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr>). Much has been written about the history of this word,
but beyond the generally accepted statement that it is of
French origin, its precise derivation still remains obscure;
<abbr title="compare">cp.</abbr> <abbr title="Norman dialect">Norm. dial.</abbr> <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hoquinano</span></em>, <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">haguinelo</span></em>, cries on New Year’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
Eve; <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hoguilanno</span></em>, a New Year’s gift. On the last day of the
year, children go in companies chiefly to the houses of the
better class, singing some such rhyme as: Rise up, gude-wife,
and shake your feathers, Dinna think that we are
beggars, We’re girls and boys come out to-day, For to get
our Hogmanay, Hogmanay, trol-lol-lay. Give us of your
white bread, and not of your grey, Or else we’ll knock at
your door a’ day (w.<abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr>); or in shorter form: Hogamanay,
hogamanay, Gi’s wor breed-an’-cheese, an’ set’s away (<abbr title="Northumberland">Nhb.</abbr>).
In earlier times it was also customary for youths to go round
dressed up as <em>guisers</em>, performing at their neighbours’ houses
a Hogmanay masque. Sometimes they went round just after
midnight to enter the houses in the capacity of <em>first-foot</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
New Year’s Day
</div>

<p class="new_para">The superstitious practice of <em>first-footing</em> belongs also to
Scotland and northern England. The first person who
crosses the threshold after midnight on New Year’s Eve is
the <em>first-foot</em> or <em>lucky-bird</em>, and the prosperity or misfortune
of the household during the ensuing year depends on what
manner of man is then admitted. On no account must the
<em>first-foot</em> be a woman. In most places the luckiest kind of
<em>first-foot</em> is a fair-haired man. A man of dark complexion,
a flat-footed man, or one afflicted with a squint brings bad
luck. But in some parts of Yorkshire where the <em>lucky-bird</em>
is the first person who enters the house on Christmas Day,
if it is a dark-haired man who thus ‘lets Christmas in’, he is
welcomed as a bringer of good luck, whilst a red-haired man
is esteemed a harbinger of ill-luck. On the whole, the safest
plan was that of engaging some recognized lucky person to
undertake the office of <em>first-foot</em>, instead of leaving the matter
in the hands of wayward chance.</p>

<p class="new_para">Another old Hogmanay-night custom was that of fetching
the <em>ream-water</em> (<abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr>) from the well. This could only be done
by a woman, in some places only by a spinster. As soon as
the clock had finished striking twelve, some female member
of the household would hurry pitcher in hand to the nearest
well, in order to be the first to skim off the water lying near
the surface and bring it home; for whoever could secure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
this, the <em>ream</em>, <em>crap</em> or <em>floo’er</em> of the water, would bring in
good fortune for the whole of the year.</p>

God-cakes, Blessing-cakes
</div>

<p class="new_para">An ancient custom in the city of Coventry is the sending
of <em>god-cakes</em> on New Year’s Day. The <em>god-cake</em> is a particular
kind of cake sent by godparents to their godchildren. It
varies in price, but its shape is invariably triangular, it is
about one inch thick, and is filled with mincemeat. A similar
custom exists in Kidderminster, where the head of the
family sends out packets of <em>blessing-cakes</em> to the scattered
representatives of the original stock, wherever they may be.
Each householder who receives a gift of cakes must again
distribute them among the members of his household,
servants included, so that every one under his roof may
receive the family blessing. The cakes are like long oval
buns, rather thin, coated on the top with melted sugar, and
ornamented with seven sultanas. As my father came from
Kidderminster, I have eaten <em>blessing-cakes</em> every New Year’s
Day as far back as my memory carries me, but I was never
clear as to the significance of the seven sultanas. I think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
they are intended to symbolize a sevenfold blessing. The
recipe for making the cakes is supposed to be a trade secret
in the possession of a certain confectioner, though some of
us think that the secret has been lost, and that the <em>blessing-cakes</em>
now savour of the common penny bun mixture. But
we should never dare to carry the comparison further, for
from our earliest youth we were made to feel it almost
a sacrilegious offence to call a <em>blessing-cake</em> a bun. After all,
it is the sentiment that matters, and that remains good and
beautiful.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

Plough Monday

<p class="new_para">The first Monday after Twelfth Day is Plough Monday,
once celebrated throughout the greater part of England.
A company of men wearing white shirts over their jackets,
decorated with ribbons, drew a plough through the village
or town. They were variously designated in different
localities as: <em>Plough-bullocks</em>, or <em>-bullockers</em>, <em>Plough-jags</em>,
<em>Plough-slots</em>, and <em>Plough-witchers</em>. Among them were usually
two special characters, the Fool, and a man dressed up
in showy female costume called the Bessy; but in some
places there were two, and even four female characters with
names such as Sweet Sis, Old Joan, Maid Marian, or col<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>lectively
named Bessybabs, Ladymadams, Queens. This
troupe performed some kind of morris-dance or sword-dance,
and collected money from the onlookers. Gradually the old
ceremonies fell into disuse, the plough no longer appeared
in the procession, and instead of the original ploughmen,
a band of children paraded the streets to keep up the memory
of Plough Monday, a day which Tusser includes among the
‘ploughmans feasting daies’, which no good housewife should

Monday” is still kept up by children and “hobbledehoys”,
who go round with blackened faces, and ribbons, <abbr class="silent" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, in
their hats, expecting that the heads of the houses visited

<p class="new_para">A convivial custom in Cornwall gives the name of Paul
Pitcher’s Day to <abbr title="January">Jan.</abbr> 24, the Eve of the Conversion of
<abbr title="Saint" class="silent">St.</abbr> Paul, a day observed as a miners’ holiday. A water-pitcher
is set up and pelted with stones till it is broken to
pieces. A new one is then bought and carried to a public-house
by the stone-throwing miners, to be filled and refilled
with beer till the whole company is drunk. On the other
hand, some people say that the name Paul Pitcher’s Day
originates with the custom of throwing broken pitchers
against the doors of dwelling-houses. Parties of lads used
to go round to the different houses, shouting as they threw
the sherds: Paul’s Eve, and here’s a heave. A mischievous
game similar to certain Shrove Tuesday pastimes.</p>

<p class="new_para">Candlemas Day, February 2, the festival of the Purification
of the Blessed Virgin Mary, was reckoned the termination
of the Christmas season. Herrick wrote: ‘End now the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
white loaf and the pie, And let all sports with Christmas die.’
The same poet also tells us that all the Christmas evergreens
used for decorations must be taken down on Candlemas Eve.
This custom was observed in Shropshire houses and churches
within the last thirty years, if not still later. At this date,
according to a common proverb: gooid geese all lay; New
Candlemas Day, good goose will lay, Old Candlemas Day
any goose will lay. There is a saying in Kent: Candlemas
Day, Half your fodder and half your hay, meaning that the
winter is only then half gone, and you ought not to have
exhausted more than half the keep for the cattle. The same
saying is also associated with Valentine’s Day. Old folks
used to say that so far as the sun shone into the house on
Candlemas Day, so far would the snow drive in before the
winter was out (<abbr title="Surrey">Sur.</abbr>).</p>

Valentine’s Day
</div>

<p class="new_para">Old Candlemas Day is February 14, better known as
Valentine’s Day. The custom of writing and of sending
valentines is out of fashion, and there remains little to mark
the day. In some country places it is still said that the
first man you meet in the morning is your valentine; and it
is a common saying that the birds on this day select their
mates for nesting. Formerly it was customary for parties of
children to <em>go valentining</em> (<abbr title="Northamptonshire">Nhp.</abbr> <abbr title="Rutland">Rut.</abbr>). They went from
house to house singing and begging, their song being usually
a form of salutation, differing slightly in different localities:
Good morrow, Valentine! Plaze to give me a Valentine,
I’ll be yourn, if ye’ll be mine, Good morrow, Valentine!;
or, Morrow, morrow, Valentine! First ’tis yours, and then
’tis mine, So please to give me a Valentine, Holly and ivy
tickle my toe, Give me red apple and let me go. In Berkshire
the following words were sung:</p>

<p class="cont">In the northern part of Northamptonshire sweet currant
buns were formerly made called <em>Valentine buns</em>, and given
by godparents to their godchildren on the Sunday preceding
and the Sunday following Valentine’s Day. A like custom
once prevailed in Rutland, where a lozenge-shaped bun called
a <em>Shittle</em> was given to children and old people on Valentine’s
Day.</p>

<p class="new_para">For the farmer, Valentine’s Day means that half your
firing and half your hay is already consumed. In Rutland
there is an old saying: Valentine’s Day, sow your beans in
the clay. David [Mch. 1] and Chad [Mch. 2], sow your beans
be the weather good or bad. Then comes Benedick [Mch. 21],
if you ain’t sowed your beans you may keep ’em in the rick.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
Sports at Shrovetide
</div>

<p class="new_para">Shrovetide in olden days was a season of sport and feasting,
the occasion for a final burst of jollity before the beginning
of Lent. As the name records, it was originally a time for
confession and absolution in preparation for the Lenten
Fast, whence also the name <em>Gooddit</em> (<abbr title="Lancashire">Lan.</abbr> <abbr title="Cheshire">Chs.</abbr> <abbr title="Staffordshire">Stf.</abbr> <abbr title="Derbyshire">Der.</abbr>), a
corruption of <em>Good-tide</em>. Shrove Tuesday is Fasten’s E’en
(<abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr> <abbr title="north Country">n.Cy.</abbr> <abbr title="north Midlands">n.Midl.</abbr>), the Eve of the great Fast of the ecclesiastical
year. There still remain in some districts traces of
the former carnival gaieties, whilst the popular eating of
pancakes on Shrove Tuesday keeps up the memory of the
ancient feasting. The day before Shrove Tuesday is Collop
Monday (<abbr title="north Country">n.Cy.</abbr>), that is, rasher-of-bacon Monday, so called
because the customary dish for this day is bacon and eggs.
In parts of Cornwall it is known as Pease-Monday, from the
custom of eating pea-soup that day, though such fare would
seem rather to be a foretaste of Lent than a festival dainty.</p>

<p class="new_para">Chief among the Shrovetide sports which have lasted
down to modern times is the well-known pastime called
<em>Lent-crocking</em> (<abbr title="Somerset">Som.</abbr> <abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr> <abbr title="Wiltshire">Wil.</abbr> <abbr title="Dorset">Dor.</abbr>), or <em>Drowin’ o’ cloam</em>,
which consists in throwing broken crockery-ware in at
doorways on the night before Shrove Tuesday, known as
Dappy-door-night, and Lentsherd-night. <em>Lead-birds</em> (<abbr title="Pembrokeshire">Pem.</abbr>)
is a game played by boys as a substitute for the obsolete
<em>cock-throwing</em>, a barbarous old Shrovetide sport, which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
perhaps further to be traced in the name <em>Lent-cocks</em> (<abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr>)
for daffodils. In the old Grammar Schools it was customary
for each scholar to contribute towards a fund for Shrovetide
cock-fighting. This contribution was called the <em>cock-penny</em>
(<abbr title="Lakeland">Lakel.</abbr> <abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr> <abbr title="Lancashire">Lan.</abbr>), and it continued to be a recognized fee
paid to the Head Master long after the sport itself had died
out. Shrovetide ball-games still survive, such as <em>bung-ball</em>
(<abbr title="Bedfordshire">Bdf.</abbr>); and <em>kep-ball</em>, the game of catch-ball which gives the
name Kepping-day (<abbr title="east Yorkshire">e.Yks.</abbr>) to Shrove Tuesday. There is
an old saying: if you don’t have a kepp on kepping-day,
you’ll be sick in harvest.</p>

<p class="new_para">The bell once rung before noon on Shrove Tuesday to
summon the penitents to their shrift, came to be looked
upon as a signal for preparing the day’s pancakes, and hence
it was termed the Pancake bell. The practice of ringing this
bell continued certainly into the last quarter of the nineteenth
century. In Worcestershire the Pancake bell was said to
ring out the words: Pot off, pan on; Pot off, pan on;
whilst in Warwickshire the message rung out was: Pan’s
a-burning; Pan’s a-burning. In Yorkshire a kind of pancake
or fritter with currants in it is eaten on Ash-Wednesday,
and the day is called Frutters’ Wednesday.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
Lenten Customs
</div>

<p class="new_para">In parts of Cornwall a straw figure dressed in cast-off
clothes and called Jack o’ Lent was formerly carried round
and then burned at the beginning of Lent. The effigy was
probably originally meant to represent Judas Iscariot. Now
the term is applied to a scarecrow, and, as a contemptuous
epithet, also to persons (<abbr title="Northamptonshire">Nhp.</abbr> <abbr title="Dorset">Dor.</abbr>).</p>

<p class="new_para">The Sundays in Lent, beginning with the second Sunday,
are thus enumerated in an old north-country saying: Tid,
Mid, Misera, Carlin, Palm, Pace egg day. It is supposed
that <em>Tid</em> is a corruption of <em>Te Deum</em>, and that <em>Misera</em> is
based on the opening words of the penitential Psalm <em>Miserere
mei, Deus</em>. The fourth Sunday in Lent is, however, more
generally known as Mothering Sunday, the day on which it
was always customary for the scattered members of the
family to visit the mother in the old home, carrying some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
small present for her in their hands. Special cakes and
dishes were associated with this festival, the most popular
being simnel cakes, and <em>frummety</em>, a dish made of <em>hulled</em>
wheat, boiled in milk, and seasoned with sugar and spice.
In some places the usual fare was veal and rice pudding;
and in others <em>fig-pie</em>—made of dried figs, sugar, treacle, and
spice—was the standing dish. In Berkshire at the present
time it is considered the proper thing to eat fig-pudding on
Palm Sunday.</p>

<p class="new_para">Carl Sunday, or Carling Sunday (<abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr> <abbr title="north Country">n.Cy.</abbr>), takes its name
from the grey or brown peas prepared and eaten on this day.
They must be steeped all night in water, and then fried in
butter. To account for this usage one tradition states that
it commemorates the action of the disciples, who, going
through the corn fields on the Sabbath day, ‘<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">plucked the
cars of corn, and did eat, rubbing them in their hands</span>,’
<cite><abbr title="Saint Luke">St.</abbr> Luke</cite> <abbr title="chapter 6 verse 1">vi. 1</abbr>; whilst a second associates it with a famine in
Newcastle, which was relieved by the arrival of a ship bearing
a cargo of grey peas or <em>carlings</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
Palm Sunday
</div>

<p class="new_para">On Palm Sunday village churches used to be decorated
with the catkin-laden twigs of the common sallow, or, as in
Kent, with branches of yew, according to the local interpretation
of the word <em>palm</em>. <em>Going a-palming</em> (<abbr title="Kent">Ken.</abbr>) meant
gathering yew twigs on the Saturday before Palm Sunday
for this purpose. In some <abbr title="south Midland">s.Midland</abbr> counties Palm Sunday
is known as Fig Sunday, dried figs being largely consumed
on this day. The probable explanation of this practice lies
in the fact that in the Gospel narrative the cursing of the
barren fig-tree is the first recorded incident of the day
following that of the triumphal entry into Jerusalem, <abbr title="compare">cp.</abbr>
<cite><abbr title="Saint" class="silent">St.</abbr> Mark</cite> <abbr title="chapter 11 verses 12 to 14">xi. 12-14</abbr>, with the result that in the popular mind
the events of two days were merged together, and the fig
was adopted as an appropriate part of the Palm Sunday
festival.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
Good Friday
</div>

<p class="new_para">An old Cheshire name for Good Friday is <em>Care Friday</em>,
a preservation of the original meaning of the word <em>care</em>, <abbr title="Old English">O.E.</abbr>
<em>caru</em>, sorrow, trouble; <abbr title="compare">cp.</abbr> <abbr title="German">Germ.</abbr> <em><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Karfreitag</span></em>, Good Friday.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
In Lancashire it was termed Long Friday, and also Crackling
Friday, from a special kind of wheaten cake given to children
on this day. The custom of eating Hot Cross buns is common
even in towns, though probably nobody now preserves them
throughout the year as a specific against diarrhoea. Up to
the middle of last century people afflicted with eye-diseases
used on Good Friday to visit <abbr title="Saint" class="silent">St.</abbr> Margaret’s Well, near
Wellington, in Shropshire, a stone cistern containing spring
water which was supposed on this day to possess eye-healing
virtues. A Good Friday sport called <em>cock-kibbit</em>, practised
in parts of Devonshire by boys, would seem to be a kind of
survival of the old Shrove Tuesday <em>cock-throwing</em>. A live
cock is put under an inverted earthenware milk-pan, and then
cudgels or <em>kibbits</em> are thrown at the pan from a fixed distance
until the pan is broken and the cock thus released. The cock
is then chased by the whole company, and it becomes the
joint property of its captor and the breaker of the milk-pan.</p>

<p class="new_para">The custom amongst farmers of sowing and planting on
Good Friday to ensure lucky crops we have already noticed
in a previous chapter. For the sowing of onion seed, however,
a still more propitious day is March 12, the Feast of

Pace-eggs
</div>

<p class="new_para">Eastertide is marked in the northern counties of England
by the custom of <em>Pace-egging</em>. The phrase itself is interesting,
for we have in it the preservation of the Latin name beside
our English <em>Easter</em>, <abbr title="compare">cp.</abbr> <abbr title="Medieval Latin">M.Lat.</abbr> <em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pascha</span></em>, the feast of the
passover. The form <em>Pace</em> or <em>Paas</em> is found in English literature
as far back as the early fifteenth century. During Holy
Week children, and sometimes grown-up persons too, go
round to the farmhouses begging for <em>Pace-eggs</em>. Some of
the eggs are used for special Easter Day cakes and custards,
but the <em>Pace-egg</em> proper is stained and hard-boiled like the
German <em><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Oster-Ei</span></em>. On Easter Monday these coloured eggs
are trundled or rolled against each other till they are broken,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
when they are eaten, and hence Easter Monday is termed
Troll-egg-day. Another form of this game is known as
<em>jauping paste-eggs</em>. One boy holds his egg, exposing the small
end, and the <em>jauper</em>, or striker, knocks the end of his egg
against it. The egg remaining unbroken is the conqueror,
and the broken egg is forfeited. Occasionally one or two
<em>Pace-eggs</em> are kept as ornaments. One such, stained pink,
and inscribed with a child’s name, and the date, ranked
among the ornaments on the parlour shelf in the Yorkshire
farmhouse where we were staying this August (1912). In the
days when mumming was still popular, the play of <abbr title="Saint" class="silent">St.</abbr> George
was performed at Easter by mummers who called themselves
<em>Pace-eggers</em>. No doubt originally they collected Easter eggs
on their rounds; indeed, a writer on Lancashire customs says
the company included a personage styled Dirty Bet, whose
duty it was to carry a basket for the collection of eggs, but
usually they played for money only, so that <em>Pace-egging</em>
came to be synonymous with mumming. A Lakeland play
began with an introductory verse as follows:</p>

<p class="new_para">An Easter custom once very common in Cheshire, Lancashire,
and the Midlands is variously termed <em>Heaving</em>,
<em>Hoisting</em>, and <em>Lifting</em>. Parties of men went round from
house to house on Easter Monday carrying a chair decorated
with evergreens, flowers, and ribbons. Wherever they came,
they seized in turn every woman of the household, and made
her sit in the chair, which they then raised as high in the air
as arms could reach, three times in succession. On Easter
Tuesday the women returned the compliment to the men.
A small fee was often paid by the lifted to the lifters. Folklorists
tell us that this strange practice was originally designed
to typify the Resurrection.</p>

<p class="cont">has been found lingering in some parts of the country. At
the beginning of the second half of the nineteenth century
there were still some people who would get up early on
Easter Day and go out into the fields to see the sun dance.
The <abbr title="Reverend" class="silent">Rev.</abbr> R. H. Cobbold, Rector of Ross, wrote on October 13,
1879: ‘In the district called Hockley, in the parish of
Broseley, a woman whose maiden name was Evans, wife of
Rowland Lloyd, a labourer, said she had heard of the thing
but did not believe it true, “till,” she said, “on Easter morning
last, I got up early, and then I saw the sun dance, and
dance, and dance, three times, and I called to my husband
and said, Rowland, Rowland, get up and see the sun dance!
I used,” she said, “not to believe it, but now I can never
doubt more.” The neighbours agreed with her that the sun
did dance on Easter morning, and some of them had seen it,’
<cite>Shropshire Folk-Lore</cite>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 335. According to a Sussex version
the sun always dances on Easter morning, but nobody has
ever seen it because the Devil is so cunning that he always
puts a hill in the way to hide it. Although Sir Thomas
Browne included this tradition in his lists of <cite>Vulgar Errors</cite>,
he evidently felt that belief in it was an outgrowth of popular
religious feeling, and that as such it must be handled with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
reverence: ‘<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">We shall not, I hope, disparage the resurrection

May-day Sports
</div>

<p class="new_para">Up to the middle of the nineteenth century the Eve of May-day
was in some northern districts known as Mischief-night,
when rough practical jokes were played by boys upon their
neighbours, gates were pulled off their hinges, and hung up
in trees, tubs and mops left out of doors were carried off and
left in some inaccessible place, and other property was
wantonly damaged.</p>

<p class="new_para">The original May-day sports and observances have long
been dead and gone, leaving only scattered traces few and
far between, but at the present time great efforts are being
made to revive the old folk-songs, dances, and mumming-plays,
and children are being taught in Board Schools how
to celebrate May-day with the traditional songs, processions,
and flowers; so that we have consequently to beware of
mistaking a revival for a survival. The May-garland would
seem, however, to be a genuine relic of the past. As seen
in Oxford, it is formed of two willow hoops, placed transversely,
and decorated with leaves and wild flowers. It is
suspended from a stick, which is held at each end by a child,
and carried thus from house to house on May morning. The
Jack-in-the-green, very common twenty or twenty-five years
ago, was a chimney-sweep enclosed in a frame of green leaves
shaped like a bower, who paraded the streets on May-day.
He is still occasionally to be seen. I myself saw one in
Oxford in 1909. The name also lingers on in figurative use
as an expression of contempt, e.g. He looked for all the world
like a Jack-in-the-green. A Bedfordshire term for a scarecrow
or a slattern is <em>moggy</em>, a name which bears a reminiscence
of the <em>maying</em> company which consisted of: my lord and my
lady, two moggys and a merry Ander. The <em>moggy</em> always
carried a ladle.</p>

Beating the Bounds
</div>

<p class="new_para">Near the beginning of May come the Rogation days, the
Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday before Ascension-day, or
Holy Thursday. These days are marked in the popular mind
by the ancient and well-known custom of beating the parish
bounds, whence arose the now obsolete name of Gang-days
(<abbr title="north Country">n.Cy.</abbr>), and the name Rammalation-day (<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr>), i.e. Perambulation-day,
for Rogation Monday. The practice is also
called Processioning (<abbr title="Midlands">Midl.</abbr> <abbr title="Somerset">Som.</abbr>), and Possessioning (<abbr title="Northamptonshire">Nhp.</abbr>).
Among dialect names for the milkwort are: Rogation Flower,
Gang Flower, and Procession Flower, showing that it was
formerly much used in making the garlands carried on these
occasions. The reason why this perambulation of the parish
boundaries takes place at Rogationtide seems to be that
originally it was purely a religious observance, a procession
of priest and people through the fields to pray for a fruitful
spring-time and harvest. In course of time the secular
object of familiarizing the growing generation with their
parish landmarks gained the upper hand, but the date
remained as testimony to the primary devotional character
of the custom. Another remnant of the religious side may
be traced in the term Gospel Tree, applied to some tree where
the Gospel was read aloud by the clergy on the occasion of
these parochial perambulations.</p>

<p class="new_para">It would seem, however, that recently some of the High
Church clergy have begun to revive in some form the old
ceremonial processions. The following paragraph appeared in
the <cite>Church Times</cite> of May&nbsp;2, 1918, under the heading Sheffield:
‘The Rogation procession, revived last year at <abbr title="Saint" class="silent">St.</abbr> Matthew’s,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
again took place this year; a perambulation of the parish was
made, incense, lights, and the beautiful silver crucifix were
used, and the vicar in cope intoned the Litany. The choir
and a good number of communicants of both sexes took part,
and the Rogation Mass was afterwards sung in church.
Another procession, with hymns and short addresses at
various stations, was announced for Tuesday evening.’
Similar processions were also made here in Oxford at the
same date.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
Whitsuntide Feasts
</div>

<p class="new_para">In former times, the season of Whitsuntide brought round
another parochial custom, namely, the holding of the
<em>Whitsun-ale</em> (<abbr title="Lincolnshire">Lin.</abbr> <abbr title="Northamptonshire">Nhp.</abbr> <abbr title="Oxfordshire">Oxf.</abbr> <abbr title="Hampshire">Hmp.</abbr>). This was a village feast
which, while it provided amusement for the parishioners in
the shape of sports and dancing, was also at the same time
made by the churchwardens a means of bringing in money
to the parish coffers for the maintenance of the church. In
Oxfordshire a similar festivity was known as a <em>Lamb-ale</em>,
and with it was associated the following sport: a fat lamb
was chased by girls with tied hands; she who caught the
lamb with her teeth was styled Lady of the Lamb, and was
conducted home with her prize in a triumphal procession.
The next day the lamb was cooked and served up to the
Lady and her companions.</p>

<p class="new_para">Thirty years ago it was still customary in some west Midland
districts to decorate village churches on Whit Sunday
with sprigs of birch stuck in holes bored in the tops of the
pews. I can remember this being done by an old parish
clerk in Herefordshire, but when he was gathered to his
fathers in the same profession, the custom died with him.</p>

<p class="new_para">The north-country <em>Rush-bearing</em> is an annual ceremony
which usually takes place concurrently with the village
Wakes. It has come down from the days when the bare
earthen floors of churches and chapels were strewn with
rushes as their only covering. The parishioners assembled
on some special day, and went out to collect the rushes,
which were then piled on a gaily decorated cart, and brought
back through the village to the accompaniment of music<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
and dancing. The custom has in many places now fallen
into disuse, but it is still kept up in Westmorland. Nowadays
the procession is formed of children who carry garlands
and emblems made of rushes and flowers, and entering the
church they lay them along the aisles. The rush-bearing
festival at Grasmere takes place on the Saturday next after
<abbr title="Saint" class="silent">St.</abbr> Oswald’s Day, August 5, and the following Sunday and
Monday. A very interesting account of it entitled ‘Rush-bearing
at Grasmere’, appeared in <cite>The Outlook</cite> of August 13,
1910. No doubt it is the connexion with Wordsworth which
has prolonged the life of this particular custom, and spread
its fame far beyond the country of its birth. It is not given
to all our ancient rural festivals to receive a ‘tributary lay’
from an immortal poet.</p>

Michaelmas and Halloween
</div>

<p class="new_para">Passing through the village of Cuddesdon on October 11,
1912, I met two or three big farm wagons going to the
hamlet of Denton, loaded with what was evidently a
farm-labourer’s household stuff. On the top of the last wagon,
wedged in securely amongst bedding and chairs, were four
or five children, merry little people, obviously enjoying the
ride through country lanes on a warm, sunny afternoon.
My companion who lived in the village remarked to me,
‘You see how Michaelmas Day is kept here according to the
Old Style. They always make their Michaelmas moves
to-day.’</p>

<p class="new_para">October 31 is Halloween (<abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr> <abbr title="north Country">n.Cy.</abbr>), the Eve of All Saints’
Day, a night specially devoted to love-divination ceremonies,
and other superstitious customs such as we have noticed in
a previous chapter. The game of <em>hanch-apple</em> (<abbr title="Cumberland">Cum.</abbr> <abbr title="Lancashire">Lan.</abbr>) is
a favourite Halloween pastime, so much so that in some
districts Hanchin’-neet is another name for Halloween. The
game consists in biting at an apple floating in water, or
suspended by a cord.</p>

<p class="new_para">In parts of Ireland a dish called <em>colcannon</em>, made of
potatoes and cabbage mashed together with butter, used to
form part of the Halloween dinner. In it was concealed a

All Souls and All Saints
</div>

<p class="new_para">November 2 is the Roman Catholic festival of All Souls,
the day on which the Church of Rome makes supplications
for the souls of the faithful departed. The ancient custom
of going out <em>souling</em> on this day was preserved in the n.Midland
counties well into the second half of last century.
Poor women, or companies of children, used to go round to
the houses of their wealthier neighbours singing certain
doggerel lines, and begging for gifts of cakes, apples, money,
<abbr class="silent" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, <abbr class="silent" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> In some districts this was done on All Saints’ Day,
the Eve of All Souls, and in others on All Souls’ Day itself.
Formerly special cakes called <em>soul-cakes</em> were baked by
housekeepers in readiness for the <em>soulers</em>, but biscuits, apples,
nuts—anything in fact given in response to their request—would
be accepted under the name of <em>soul-cakes</em>. There are
various versions of the traditional <em>souling-song</em>. This is a
Cheshire version: Soul, soul, a apple or two; If ye han noo
apples, pears ’un do; Please, good Missis, a soul-cake; Put
yur hand t’yur pocket, Tak’ ait yur keys, Go dain i’ yur cellar,
Bring what yo please, A apple, a pear, A plum, or a cherry,
Or any good thing That’ll make us all merry. Or again, there
is the simple cry: A cake, a cake, For All Souls’ sake (<abbr title="Derbyshire">Der.</abbr>).</p>

Day, and to November 25, <abbr title="Saint" class="silent">St.</abbr> Catherine’s Day, were kept
up in some <abbr title="south Midland">s.Midland</abbr> counties. Children went from house
to house singing verses and begging for apples and pence,
a practice known as <em>Catterning and Clemmening</em> (<abbr title="Warwickshire">War.</abbr> <abbr title="Worcestershire">Wor.</abbr>
<abbr title="Staffordshire">Stf.</abbr> <abbr title="Sussex">Sus.</abbr>). A Worcestershire version of the Cattern Day
song runs: Catten and Clemen come year by year; Some
of your apples and some of your beer! Some for Peter, some
for Paul, Some for Him as made us all. Clement was a good
old man, For his sake give us some. Plum, plum, cherry,
cherry, Give us good ale to make us merry, Apples to roast
and nuts to crack, And a barrel of cider on the tap. Up the
ladder and down the can, Give us a red apple and we’ll be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
gone. The following is a Warwickshire <em>Clementing</em> rhyme:
Clemancing, clemancing, year by year, Apples and pears are
very good cheer; One for Peter, two for Paul, And three
for the Man that made us all. Up with your stocking, and
down with your shoe; If you’ve got no apples, money’ll do.
Clement was a good old man, For his sake give us some;
None of the worst, but some of the best. I pray God send
your soul to rest. This closely resembles some of the souling-songs,
in which the couplet: One for Peter, <abbr class="silent" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, also occurs
word for word the same.</p>

<p class="new_para"><abbr title="Saint" class="silent">St.</abbr> Clement is the blacksmiths’ patron saint, and in parts
of Sussex blacksmiths used to hold a feast on November 23
in his honour. Over the door of the inn where the feast took
place a figure dressed up with a wig, a beard, and a pipe, was
set up, and called Old Clem. In Surrey it was customary to
<em>fire the anvil</em> on <abbr title="Saint" class="silent">St.</abbr> Clement’s Day. This was done by setting
light to a charge of gunpowder placed beneath a wooden
plug or wedge driven into a hole in the top of the anvil.</p>

<p class="new_para">November 30 is <abbr title="Saint" class="silent">St.</abbr> Andrew’s Day. In Bedfordshire and
Buckinghamshire special cakes were formerly eaten on this
day, called <em>Tandrew cakes</em>, <em>Tandry cakes</em>, and <em>Tandry wigs</em>.
They were plain dough cakes or buns ornamented with
currants and caraway seeds, made in honour of <abbr title="Saint" class="silent">St.</abbr> Andrew,
the patron saint of lace-makers. But since the lace trade has
become less profitable, to <em>keep Tandry</em>, i.e. to keep the

<p class="new_para">Bricklayers in Sussex used to <em>go <abbr title="Saint" class="silent">St.</abbr> Andring</em>. This meant

drink, the squirrels being carried home to be stuffed or eaten.</p>

<p class="new_para">To December 21, the festival of <abbr title="Saint" class="silent">St.</abbr> Thomas, belongs the
old custom known as going <em>a-gooding</em>, <em>a-mumping</em>, or <em>a-Thomasing</em>,
a practice once common all over England from
Cheshire and Yorkshire to East Anglia and Cornwall. In
some places it has been preserved up to quite modern times.
To go <em>a-gooding</em> means to go from house to house on <abbr title="Saint" class="silent">St.</abbr>
Thomas’ Day begging for money or gifts in kind wherewith to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
furnish the Christmas table. This was generally done by
poor widows, but also often by people who would never
think of begging at any other time of year. Formerly every
farmer set aside a sack of corn for the <em>mumpers</em>, some of
them needy widows, some of them married women with
their families, wives of the holders of cottages on the farm.
These all went to receive each a dole of corn. In course of
time the doles given took the form of money and food,
including perhaps a pint of wheat for making frumenty.
An old <em>Thomasing</em> rhyme runs thus: Well-a-day, well-a-day,
<abbr title="Saint" class="silent">St.</abbr> Thomas goes too soon away, Then your gooding we do
pray, For the good time will not stay. <abbr title="Saint" class="silent">St.</abbr> Thomas grey,

Please to remember <abbr title="Saint" class="silent">St.</abbr> Thomas Day (<abbr title="Staffordshire">Stf.</abbr>). In these latter
days children go <em>a-Thomasing</em> for halfpence, singing hymns
instead of the old traditional begging rhymes.</p>

Customs on Christmas Eve
</div>

<p class="new_para">Christmas is everywhere the most popular festival of the
whole year, combining as it does the religious and social
sides of life in a way none of the other ecclesiastical Holy-days
do. The Church with its message of ‘Peace on earth,
goodwill towards men’, as it were, comes down and takes
the hand of the people and says let us unite together to
celebrate the mystery of family life at the altar of the home.
Hence it appeals more forcibly than any other festival to
young and old, rich and poor, town-dweller and country
rustic, without distinction of creed or class. Owing to this
universal popularity, many of the old Christmas customs are
yet with us, and most of those which are dying or dead are
kept before our minds by writers of Christmas stories, and
illustrators of <cite>Christmas Numbers</cite>.</p>

Mummings and Wassailing
</div>

<p class="new_para">Christmas Eve was the great night for the mummers who
acted the play of <abbr title="Saint" class="silent">St.</abbr> George and the Dragon; or again,
there were men and boys who carried round a wooden figure
representing a horse’s head, the mouth of which was made
to open and shut by means of a string. Sometimes it was
the skull of a dead horse, decorated with ribbons, and supported
on a pole by a man concealed under a sheet. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
figure was called Old Hob (<abbr title="Cheshire">Chs.</abbr>), Mari Lwyd or Merry Hewid
(<abbr title="Wales">Wal.</abbr>), and in Kent the performance was known as <em>Hodening</em>.
In some northern counties the mummers were termed
<em>guisers</em>, and in Sussex and Hampshire, <em>tipteerers</em>, or <em>tip-teariers</em>.
The children used to go <em>a-wassailing</em> carrying
a decorated bough, or a garland which they called a <em>wessel-bob</em>,
and singing doggerel verses such as: Here we come
a-wassailing, Among the leaves so green; Here we come
a-singing, So fair to be seen. The <em>vessel-cup</em>, or <em>bezzle-cup</em>—both
words being corruptions of <em>wassail-cup</em>, due to popular
etymology—was a box containing two dolls representing
the Virgin and Child, carried round by women or by children
who sang this carol: God bless the maysther of this hoose,
The mistheress also; An’ all the lahtle intepunks, That round
the table go (<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr>).</p>

<p class="new_para">A quaint custom at Dewsbury in Yorkshire is the ringing
of the <em>Devil’s knell</em> on Christmas Eve. The bells toll first
a hundred strokes, then a pause, then three strokes, three
strokes, and three strokes again, to signify that the Devil
died when Christ was born.</p>

<p class="new_para">It is still customary in the West Riding of Yorkshire to
eat <em>spice-cake</em> at Christmas time. It is a rich cake containing
currants, sultanas, spices and candied peel, made only at this
season of the year, and eaten together with cheese. In
Northumberland and Durham children are given a cake
called a <em>Yule-babby</em>, or <em>Yule-dough</em>, a figure made in ginger-bread
or dough, rolled out flat, and cut out with a head,
arms and body. The arms are folded across, and two
currants put in for eyes. In Shrewsbury and the neighbourhood
it was customary to eat <em>wigs</em> or caraway buns dipped in
ale for supper on Christmas Eve. An East Anglian Christmas
cake is the <em>kickel</em>, a flat triangular cake with currants

Wren-hunting on Christmas Day

<p class="new_para">Wren-hunting was formerly a Christmas Day practice in
Ireland. The following day, <abbr title="Saint" class="silent">St.</abbr> Stephen’s Day, the slaughtered
birds tied to a bush decked with ribbons, were carried
round by young lads, called <em>wren-boys</em>, who begged for
money, and sang a song, one version of which begins thus:
The wran, the wran, the king of all birds, <abbr title="Saint" class="silent">St.</abbr> Stephen’s Day
is caught in the furze; Although he is little his family is
great—Rise up, landlady, and give us a trate. Various
legends are told in explanation of the origin of this custom.
According to one story, the Jews were searching for <abbr title="Saint" class="silent">St.</abbr>
Stephen, when his hiding-place was betrayed to them by
the noisy cries of a couple of wrens flying in and out of
a furze-bush where the saint lay concealed. The custom has
also been found in the Isle of Man, Wales, and parts of
England, the song varying in different localities, and in
some places the wren being carried round on Twelfth Day
instead of on <abbr title="Saint" class="silent">St.</abbr> Stephen’s Day.</p>

<p class="new_para">December 28 is Holy Innocents’ Day, popularly called
Childermas Day. In many parts of England, notably the
northern counties and Cornwall, this day has always been
regarded as unlucky. People would refrain from starting
on a journey, or beginning a new undertaking, and housewives
would even forbear to wash clothes on this day.
Indeed so forceful is its evil influence that the day of the
week on which it fell was marked as a black one throughout
the ensuing year (<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr>). Dr. Johnson gives this superstitious
belief in his definition of Childermas Day: ‘The day of the
week, throughout the year, answering to the day on which
the feast of the holy Innocents is solemnized, which weak
and superstitious persons think an unlucky day.’</p>

opening or consecration. It is everywhere the great gathering
time for distant friends and relations; the one important
event of the year from which all dates are reckoned, e.g. ’Twill
be a year cum next Heetown Wake. In the north of England
the mills and workshops close during the Tide; all is holiday-mirth
and hospitality. People will pinch and scrape for
weeks beforehand in order to be able to afford a goodly joint
of Tide-beef, or Wake-beef, to provide which herds of fat
oxen have been slain in readiness; and every good housewife
prepares a store of cakes, tarts, pies, and pasties.

Mops or Hiring Fairs
</div>

<p class="new_para">Beside the purely merry-making fairs were the Hiring, or
Statute fairs, held usually in the autumn, often about
Martinmas, <abbr title="November">Nov.</abbr> 11; but these, too, have mostly developed
into pleasure fairs. The young men and girls who came to
seek places as farm-labourers and maid-servants, used to
stand, clad in their ‘Sunday best’, on either side of the
principal street, the men wearing emblems of service in
their hats. Thus the plough-boy or carter had a piece of
whip-cord; the shepherd a lock of wool; and the cowherd
a tuft of cow-hair. It is said that the name <em>Mop</em> which is
widely used in the Midlands instead of <em>Stattis</em> [Statutes] is
derived from this old custom of carrying the badge of office,
and refers to the mop borne by the servant-girls. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
contracts made between employer and employed at the
Mop were binding for the following twelve months. A fee,
formerly termed in the northern counties the <em>God’s-penny</em>,
but later more generally the <em>fastening-penny</em>, was given by
the employer to the servant as earnest-money. It varied
in amount from one shilling to a pound. If the servant
changed his or her mind before entering the service, he or
she returned the <em>God’s-penny</em> to the employer; and on the
other hand, if the employer changed his mind and refused
to take the servant, he forfeited the fee. The relative merits
of various ‘places’, and warnings against ‘bad meat houses’,
i.e. houses where scant rations prevailed, were transmitted
to new generations of servants in doggerel verses repeated
at the hirings, such as: Bradford breedless, Harnham heedless,
Shaftee pick at the craa; Capheaton’s a wee bonny
place, But Wallin’ton bangs [excels] them aa (<abbr title="Northumberland">Nhb.</abbr>).</p>

<p class="new_para">A Runaway Mop was a statute hiring-fair held a few weeks
after the customary ones, said to be composed of servants
who had been hired at a previous fair, and had run away
from their situations. In the <cite>Evesham Journal</cite> of October 16,
1897, there appeared an announcement stating that ‘The
runaway mop [at Stratford-on-Avon] will be held on
October 22nd’. A Mop Fair is still held in Stratford-on-Avon.
In the <cite>Daily Sketch</cite> of October&nbsp;14, 1912, appeared an illustration
entitled ‘Roasting the Ox at Stratford Mop Fair’, with
this note appended: ‘The Stratford-on-Avon Mop Fair,
which dates from the reign of King John, was held on
Saturday. Six excursion trains ran from London, and
specials arrived from many towns. The ox-roasting in the
streets was one of the principal sights of the Fair, seven
bullocks and a dozen pigs being spitted.’</p>

Hiring-fairs, an imitation of customs once in vogue on these
occasions, either derived directly from the Fairs or from

<p class="new_para">Children’s games form a study in themselves. Nobody
who has once dipped into one of the two big volumes of that
scholarly and intensely interesting work by Mrs. Gomme,
entitled <cite>The Traditional Games of England, Scotland, and
Ireland</cite>, can fail to be struck by the importance of games
as a mirror of real life. Indeed—to quote the words of
Mrs. Gomme’s closing paragraph—‘it is not ... too much
to say that we have in these children’s games some of the
oldest historical documents belonging to our race, worthy
of being placed side by side with the folk-tale and other
monuments of man’s progress from savagery to civilisation.’</p>

<p class="new_para">After reading her book I look back with a new sense of
pleasure to the village school-treats, where I joined in the
singing games played on the lawns of our old Rectory home in
Herefordshire. It is a source of great gratification to me to
think that in: Nuts in May—which should properly be read
Knots of May, i.e. bunches of hawthorn-blossom—I reenacted
marriage by capture; that in: Here come three
Spaniards out of Spain, A-courting of your daughter Jane.
<abbr title="Answer">Ans.</abbr> My daughter Jane is yet too young, She cannot bear

when I adjured the kneeling Sally Water to: Sprinkle in the
pan, and then: Rise Sally, rise Sally, Choose your young
man, I was calling her to the performance of a marriage
ceremony the chief feature of which was some rite connected
with water-worship, a relic of the pre-Celtic inhabitants of
the British Isles; that when I formed one of a circle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
little girls playing the ever-popular Who goes round my

I like to think that as the centre player in: Wind up the old
Yew-tree, I personified a sacred Tree, encircled by a band
of worshippers stamping on the ground to arouse the sleeping
Earth-spirit. London Bridge was another very favourite
game at those school-treats, but little did we know that it
originated in the barbarous custom of foundation sacrifice.
I cannot remember that we ever performed the game of:
Mother, mother, the pot boils over, with its traces of customs
belonging to fire-worship and the worship of the hearth.</p>

Antiquity of Games
</div>

<p class="new_para">Of less hoary antiquity are the customs represented in
Jenny Jones, where Jenny dies, and her corpse is dressed
in white and carried to the grave by her maiden friends,
weeping as they go. Our Herefordshire version of the song
was a decadent one, for we always called the heroine Jenora,
and we decided that commonplace ‘black’ is ‘for dead
people’. Here we enacted the funeral to the bitter end, till
Jenora—or her embodied ghost—rose up from the grave and
chased the shrieking mourners. But in Wallflowers and
Green Gravel we lamented the death of a maiden only by
turning our faces ‘to the wall’ to indicate hopeless grief.</p>

<p class="new_para">Even those apparently mere baby games which we played
with the infant scholars, such as Mulberry Bush, accompanied
by actions of daily life, and Ring a Ring o’ Roses,
with its allusion to the ceremonial use of flowers, the bowing
to the ground, and the sneezing, should probably be regarded
with the respect due to survivals of ancient sacred dances.
We learn, too, that the primitive element may also be traced
in the simple games of Touch and Tig, where ‘he’ or ‘it’
would seem to be a tabooed person; and that in the game of
Hoblionkers, so common in Oxford, may be found ‘evidence
of the early belief that the possession of a weapon which
had, in the hands of a skilful chief, done great execution,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
would give additional skill and power to the person who
succeeded in obtaining it’.</p>

<p class="new_para">Beside the games which exhibit traces of pre-Christian
religion and social custom are the later historical games
played by boys, such as Scots and English, and We are the
Rovers, dating from the inroads of the Scots, or from the
threatened invasion of Napoleon, games which, by comparison
with the others, seem to be of mushroom growth.
But it is needless further to recapitulate what has been
better said elsewhere, and it would be hard to find a game
of any sort which is not fully described in Mrs. Gomme’s

throughout the British Isles would probably show a larger
and more varied vocabulary of technical terms and phrases
than almost any other game. To begin with, there are the
different dialect names denoting the different species of
marbles, for example: balser, bobber or dobber, bullocker,
dogle, dolledger, fifer, frenchie, kabber, ligganie, pot-donnock,
<abbr class="silent" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, <abbr class="silent" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>; then the names for the different varieties
of the game, such as: bungums, dab-at-the-hole, doorie,
drop-eye, dykey, follow-tar, lag, langie-spangie, nanks,
plonks and spans, rackups, ringhams, rumps, <abbr class="silent" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, <abbr class="silent" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>; and
lastly, there is the rich assortment of exclamations and
expressions used by the players, as for instance: A-rant!
No custance! Dubs! Fen keeps! Gobs! Heights! Layers!
Lights up and no bird-eggs! Lodge! No first my redix!
Roonses! <abbr class="silent" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, <abbr class="silent" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>; to fub, to fullock, to gull, to grumphey,
to hagger, to murl, to plonk, to strake, to play freezers, to
play kibby, <abbr class="silent" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, <abbr class="silent" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr></p>

<p class="new_para">Many of the good old nursery jingles appear in quaint
guise in the dialects. The following is an Isle of Wight
version of This little pig went to market, used when counting
a baby’s fingers or toes: This gurt pig zays, I wants meeat;
T’other one zays, Where’ll ye hay et? This one zays, In
gramfer’s barn; T’other one zays, Week! Week! I can’t
get over the dreshel [threshold]. In Scotland they say: This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
ain biggit the baurn, This ain stealt the corn, This ain stood
and saw, This ain ran awa’, An’ wee pirlie-winkie paid for a’.
A Scottish version of This is the way the ladies ride, used
when dancing a child on the knee, runs: This is the way
the ladies rides, Jimp and sma’, jimp and sma’; This is the
way the gentlemen rides, Spurs an a’, spurs an a’; This is
the way the cadgers rides, Creels an a’, creels an a’.</p>

Country Children’s Rhymes
</div>

<p class="new_para">Country children often repeat certain rhymes when they
meet with some particular insect or other creature; or when
they hear the note of some familiar bird. In the latter
case, the words used are sometimes intended as a gloss on the
cry of the bird, as for example: Steal two coos, Taffy, Steal
two coos, which is what the wood-pigeon says, according to
the Welshman’s story, when he was asked why he stole the
cows. When Berkshire children hear the wood-pigeon they
sing: My toe bleeds, Betty! My toe bleeds, Betty! Northamptonshire
children on hearing the blackbird, sing: Draw
the knave a cup of beer, Be quick, quick, quick! In many
dialects the generic name for a moth is <em>miller</em>, but the term
is more specially applied to large white moths. When
children catch such a one they sing: Millery, millery, doustipoll,
How many zacks hast thee astole? Vow’r an’ twenty,
and a peck; Hang the miller up by’s neck (<abbr title="Hampshire">Hmp.</abbr>); Miller,
miller, blow your horn! You shall be hanged for stealing
corn (<abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr>). A woodlouse is called Granfer Grig (<abbr title="Wiltshire">Wil.</abbr> <abbr title="Somerset">Som.</abbr>),
and the following are the lines to a woodlouse to make it
curl up: Granfer Grig killed a pig, Hung un up in corner;
Granfer cried and Piggy died, And all the fun was over.
There are several rhymes addressed to snails in various
localities, for example: Snarley-’orn, put out your corn,
Father and mother’s dead (<abbr title="Somerset">Som.</abbr>); Sneely-snawl, put out
your horn, The beggars are coming to steal your corn, At
six o’clock in the morning (<abbr title="Lincolnshire">Lin.</abbr>); Snag, snag, put out your
horn, And I will give you a barleycorn (<abbr title="Sussex">Sus.</abbr>); Hodmadod,
hodmadod, pull out your horns, Here comes a beggarman to
cut off your corns (<abbr title="Suffolk">Suf.</abbr>). Children in Northumberland call
a scarlet ladybird a <em>sodger</em>. When they have caught one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
they throw it up in the air and say: Reed, reed sodger, fly
away, And make the morn a sunny day. But the commonest
rhyme addressed to a ladybird is: Cowlady, cowlady, hie
thee way whum! Thy haase is afire, thy childer all gone,
All but poor Nancy set under a pan, Wavin’ gold lace as fast
as she can (<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr>). There are versions of this rhyme in various
dialects. To irritate turkeys boys will shout at them:
Bubbly Jock, Bubbly Jock, Bubbly Jock the satter, Yor
faithor’s deed, yor mother’s deed, ye canna flee nae fawthor
(<abbr title="Northumberland">Nhb.</abbr>); or: Lubber, lubber-leet, Look at your dirty feet
(<abbr title="Cornwall">Cor.</abbr>); or: What d’ye hang yer vather wi’? to which the
turkey is supposed to reply, Holter, holter, holter. When
a Lincolnshire hen cackles she is believed to say: Cuca,
cuca, cayit, I’ve laid an egg, cum ta’ it. Norfolk boys scare
rooks and crows from corn by shouting: Bird, a bird, a wook,
Here come the clappers To knock ye down back’ards.
Carwo! Carwoo—oh!</p>

intimate acquaintance told him it was hot or cold, wet or dry, windy

<p class="new_para">In all ranks of life the weather is the one great topic for
casual conversations and salutations; and thanks to the
blessed uncertainty of our English climate we have a wide
field, and seldom need to repeat the same remark two days
running. Dialect-speakers, however, have the advantage
over us of the standard language, in that they possess so
many good descriptive adjectives and metaphorical expressions
which we lack. The rustic, moreover, accepts the
weather as he finds it, and puts plain facts into words, he
does not abuse unalterable conditions in the way we are so
apt to do, as if a cold wind, or drizzling rain were a personal
insult not to be borne. Sometimes we even descend to
unadulterated slang, as did the two charming and well-dressed
maidens I once heard greet each other in the street
thus: ‘Awful weather, isn’t it!’ said the one. ‘Beastly!’
retorted the other, and they passed on. One was reminded
of the girl in the fairy-tale who was condemned for her sins
to let fall a toad each time she opened her mouth to speak.</p>

Phrases describing the Weather
</div>

<p class="new_para">For describing the weather in realistic and at the same
time picturesque terms, some of the dialect phrases would
be hard to beat. Take for example these: It’s a donky day,
Ben! Ey, rayder slattery. Varra slashy! Ay, parlish soft.
Here’s a sharp mwornin’, John! Ey, as snell as a step<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>mother’s

t’skin, an’ hedn’t a dhry threed aboot ma. T’weather wor
seea pelsy, followed wi’ sitch a snithe, hask wind. A cold
snarzling wind. When the air is so cold that it will not allow
any one to stand idle: There’s a good steward about. On
the Cumberland Fells there is always a <em>bone</em> in the air. When
the day looks bright and pleasant, but there is a chill nip in
the air, it is a <em>sly</em> day; when it is cold and foggy, it is <em>hunch-weather</em>,
because it makes men and animals hunch up their
shoulders; when it is very cold with a piercing wind it is
<em>peel-a-bone</em> weather; and when it rains very hard it is:
Raining pitchforks with the tines downwards. A raging,
blustering wind goes <em>wuthering</em> across a bleak moor, whence
the name of Mr. Heathcliff’s dwelling <cite>Wuthering Heights</cite>.
When the sky shows streaks of windy-looking cloud, and the
weather seems doubtful it: Looks skeowy; an unusually
bright day is: Too glisky to last; when a fine rain is falling:
It hadders and roäks. A kind of hoar-frost peculiar to
Dartmoor is known as <em>the ammil</em>, a term which is apparently
a figurative use of <em>amel</em>, i.e. enamel (<abbr title="compare">cp.</abbr> ‘<em><span lang="frm" xml:lang="frm">Esmail</span></em>, <span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">ammel or
enammel</span>’, <abbr title="Cotgrave">Cotgr.</abbr>), used to denote the thin coating of transparent
ice which covers every twig, and leaf, and blade of
grass. On a calm, hot day, when the air near the surface
of the ground is seen to quiver in the sunlight: The summer-colt
rides, or: The summer-goose flackers; the Northern
Lights are the Merry Dancers; heavy masses of fleecy white
cloud are Wool-packs, or they are the Shepherd’s Flock.
The evening star becomes the Shepherd’s Lamp, whilst the
moon, more prosaically, does duty as the Parish Lantern.</p>

Weather Rhymes and Sayings

<p class="new_para">To the countryman who lives by tilling the soil, or by
tending sheep and cattle, the prospect of fair days or foul

of weather-lore, in part based on old superstition, in part on
trustworthy observation. Sun, moon, and stars, clouds and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
wind, the habits of animals, and the various signs of the
approach of winter, or the advent of spring, are all observed
and studied, and then, in course of time, the results of this
observation have become crystallized in popular sayings
and homely rhymes.</p>

<p class="new_para">When the sky has a <em>cruddled</em> appearance, that is, when it
is covered with small fleecy clouds called Hen-scrattins
(<abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr> <abbr title="north Country">n.Cy.</abbr> <abbr title="Midlands">Midl.</abbr>), it means that the weather will be: Neither
long wet nor yet long dry. The same is said of the long
streaky clouds called Filly-tails (<abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr> <abbr title="north Country">n.Cy.</abbr>), Mares’-tails
(<abbr title="general dialects">gen. dials.</abbr>), and Goat’s-hair (<abbr title="Northumberland">Nhb.</abbr>). When a thick band of
cloud lies across the west, with smaller bands above and
below, it is: Barbara and her barns [children], a sign of
stormy weather (<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr>). The name is an allusion to <abbr title="Saint" class="silent">St.</abbr> Barbara,
whose father was about to strike off her head, when
a lightning flash laid him dead at her feet. Hence she was
supposed to command the thunderstorm, and was invoked
as a protectress. When dingy packs on Criffel lower, Then
hoose yer kye an’ stuik yer duir, But if Criffel be fair an’
clear, For win’ or weet ye needn’t fear (<abbr title="Cumberland">Cum.</abbr>). A small dark
cloud such as Elijah’s servant beheld when he looked toward
the sea from the top of Carmel, is called a Dyer’s-neäf
[hand], and betokens rain as it did in Ahab’s time, for:
A dyer’s neaf an’ a weather-gall Shepherds warn at rain’ll
fall (<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr>). A Weather-gall (<abbr title="north Country">n.Cy.</abbr>) is the stump of a rainbow
left visible above the horizon. A Weather-breeder (<abbr title="north Country">n.Cy.</abbr>
<abbr title="north Midlands">n.Midl.</abbr> <abbr title="East Anglia">e.An.</abbr>) is a fine warm day out of season, regarded as
the precursor of stormy weather. When streaks of light are
seen radiating from the sun behind a cloud, the sun is said
to be <em>drawing wet</em>, for the Sun-suckers (<abbr title="Cheshire">Chs.</abbr> <abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr>) are sucking
up moisture from the earth, to form rain. Roger’s blast
(<abbr title="East Anglia">e.An.</abbr>) is a kind of miniature whirlwind, which suddenly on

the field, high in the air, to herald the approaching rain.</p>

and the call of the green woodpecker is the warning signal:
Wet! wet! wet! (<abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr> <abbr title="Somerset">Som.</abbr>). It is a sign of rain when
<em>th’ craws plaays football</em>, that is, when the rooks gather
together in large bodies, and circle round each other; when
the ducks <em>do squacketty</em> (<abbr title="Somerset">Som.</abbr>), or when they throw water
from their bills over their heads (<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr>); when the swallows

<abbr title="East Anglia">e.An.</abbr>). If it lies north and south it denotes rain, but lying
east and west it denotes fine weather (<abbr title="Cumberland">Cum.</abbr>). Or again, it is
held that if the Ark remains three days, the wind will pass

Popular Meteorology

<p class="new_para">If a robin sings on a high branch of a tree it is a sign of
fine weather, but if one sings near the ground the weather
will be wet (<abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr>). An old saying about the <em>wood-seer</em> (<abbr title="Northamptonshire">Nhp.</abbr>),
the little green insect found in the white froth deposited on
plants, is that when its head is turned upwards it betokens
fine weather, and when downward, the reverse.</p>

<p class="new_para">In changeable weather the rain is said to come and go
<em>by planets</em> (<abbr title="Derbyshire">Der.</abbr> <abbr title="Leicestershire">Lei.</abbr> <abbr title="East Anglia">e.An.</abbr>), or if rain falls with great violence,
but very locally, it is said to fall <em>in planets</em> (<abbr title="north Country">n.Cy.</abbr>), phrases
which must be remnants of old astrological beliefs.</p>

<p class="new_para">The presence of sea-gulls inland is generally taken as an
indication of stormy weather: Sea-mo, sea-mo, bide on
t’sand, Theer nivver good weather when thoo’s on t’land

rhyme runs: When the say-gulls cry by lan’, ’Tis time to
take the zellup [seed-leap, i.e. seed-basket for sowing] in
han’; When the say-gulls cry by say, ’Tis time to draw the
zellup away. In Shetland there is an old rhyme concerning
the movements of the <em>rain-goose</em>, or red-throated diver:
If the rain göse flees ta da hill, Ye can geng ta da haf whin
ye will; But whin shö gengs ta da sea, Ye maun draw up

If’t cums on rain when t’teyde’s at flowe, You may yoke

<cite><abbr title="Saint Matthew">St. Matt.</abbr></cite> <abbr title="chapter 16 verses 2 and 3">xvi. 2,&nbsp;3</abbr>. Another very common adage is: Rain

people will tell you that when you see the cattle on the tops
of the hills, it is a sign of fine weather. The early mist
called the <em>pride of the morning</em> (<abbr title="north Country">n.Cy.</abbr> <abbr title="Midlands">Midl.</abbr> <abbr title="Dorset">Dor.</abbr>), <em>harr</em>,

Foretelling the Seasons

<p class="new_para">But popular meteorology does not confine itself to foretelling
the weather of the immediate future; there are
plenty of prophetic utterances concerning the seasons, and
their effects on the crops of weeks and even months ahead.
For instance: If the ice will bear a man before Christmas, it
will not bear a mouse afterwards. If the sun shine through
the apple-tree on Christmas Day there will be an abundant
crop of apples in the following year. If the wind is in the west
at noon on Candlemas Day it will be a good year for fruit.
If Cannlemas Day be lound [calm] and fair, Yaw hawf o’

will be next March (<abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr>). Where the wind is at Holland-tide,
the Season of All Saints, it will be most of the winter

Tusser’s ‘Husbandrie’
</div>

<p class="new_para">From weather lore we are naturally led to turn to the
farm and the farmer, and here, at the outset, we are reminded
of that father of English ‘Husbandrie’, Thomas Tusser.
Writers on Literature tell us that he was one of the most
popular authors of his time, judging from the number of
editions through which his work—<cite><span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">A Hundreth Good Pointes
of Husbandrie</span></cite>, afterwards enlarged to <cite><span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Fiue hundred pointes
of good Husbandrie</span></cite>—passed in the first forty years after its
publication in 1557. A further testimony to the popularity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
of the book lies in the fact that copies of any one of the
thirteen editions of this period are very scarce, and nearly
all imperfect. It certainly is a most attractive handbook
to farming, and one can easily imagine how the family copy
would be thumbed by father and son, consulting it on every
occasion for its practical advice, useful information, and
homely maxims, till the book fell to pieces. A glance at
Tusser’s ‘<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Table of the pointes of husbandrie mentioned in
this booke</span>’ will show that he does not confine himself
strictly to agricultural subjects. Here we find: ‘<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">A description
of life and riches</span>,’ ‘<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Against fantastical scruplenes</span>,’
‘<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">A Christmas caroll</span>,’ ‘<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">A Sonet against a slaunderous tongue</span>,’
sandwiched in between such titles as: ‘<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Seedes and hearbes
for the kitchen</span>,’ ‘<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">A medicine for faint cattle</span>,’ ‘<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Howe to
fasten loose teeth in a bullocke</span>,’ and the ‘<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Abstract</span>’ for
every month in succession. His verses may not be poetical,
but they contain much matter plainly expressed in little
room, and their good rhythm and rhyme made them easy
to remember. For example:</p>

Husbandry in Rhyme
</div>

<p class="new_para">‘Good husbandlie lessons’ stored up in rhymes in the
manner of Tusser may still be found in rural districts. For
example: When the cuckoo comes to the bare thorn, Sell
your cow and buy your corn (<abbr title="Sussex">Sus.</abbr>). When the slae tree is
white as a sheet, Sow your barley, whether it be dry or weet
(<abbr title="Northumberland">Nhb.</abbr>). When elum leaves are as big as a farden, It’s time
to plant kidney-beans in the garden. When the moon is at
the full, Mushrooms you may freely pull; But when the
moon is on the wane, Wait ere you think to pluck again (<abbr title="Essex">Ess.</abbr>).
Shear you sheep in May, and shear them all away (<abbr title="Worcestershire">Wor.</abbr>).
If you marl land, you may buy land; If you marl moss,
there is no loss; If you marl clay, you fling all away (<abbr title="Lincolnshire">Lin.</abbr>).</p>

<p class="new_para">There is an old farmer’s saying in Rutland: One boy is
a boy, two boys is half a boy, and three boys is no boy at all.
According to a Cumberland adage, the ‘good husband’—as
Tusser would call him—says: Come, goway to yer wark
wid me, lads; while ‘unthrift his brother’ says: Howay
to yer wark, lads, and leaves them to go by themselves.</p>

<p class="new_para">It is interesting to recognize familiar sayings under a figure
taken from farming. For instance: to have other oats to
thresh, or another rig to hoe, is equivalent to other fish to
fry; to shear [reap] one’s own rig, is to paddle one’s own
canoe; to plough the headlands before the butts, is to
begin a thing at the wrong end. The <em>headland</em> is the strip of
land left unploughed at the ends of a field on which the
plough turns, hence: to turn on a mighty narrow adlant,
means to have a narrow escape. <em>Pay-rent</em> is a good practical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
synonym for profitable, e.g. A proper pay-rent sort o’ pigs;
A rare pay-rent piece o’ beans.</p>

<p class="new_para">A <em>way-ganging</em> crop is the last crop belonging to a tenant
before he leaves a farm, a phrase which is picturesquely
applied to an old man nearing his end.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
Decay of old Farming Customs
</div>

<p class="new_para">Numbers of the old agricultural terms so common a
generation or two ago, have now become obsolete, since the
implements to which they belonged have given place to
newer machinery. Twenty or thirty years ago one was
accustomed to hearing the thud of the flail resounding on the
barn floor, but now the threshing-machine does the work,
and we have to look in dictionaries if we want to understand
what was meant by a <em>dreshel</em>, and what parts of it were the
<em>handstaff</em>, <em>soople</em>, and <em>capel</em>, and what happened to the barley
when submitted to the <em>faltering-iron</em>. Reaping-machines,
again, have superseded the older methods of <em>shearing</em> with
the <em>sheckel</em>, the <em>badging-hook</em>, or the <em>fagging-hook</em>. We
seldom hear the sound of the mower whetting his scythe, nor
do we see Phillis hasting out of her bower ‘With Thestylis to
bind the sheaves’. These are sounds and sights to read of in
poetry, like the whilome glories of our wayside hedgerows,
now cloaked under a grey pall of dust thrown over them by
the passing motor.</p>

<p class="new_para">The decay of old customs belonging to farming is chiefly
noticeable in connexion with the ingathering of the harvest,
and the celebration of its completion. Many causes have
combined of late years to make farming an anxious and
unremunerative industry, so that there is no longer the real
joy in harvest that there used to be; a fact which must be
reckoned together with the changes which have been wrought
by the introduction of machinery, and by the increase in
means of locomotion which brings hireling harvesters from
distant parts, and carries away the young people who used
to grow up on the same farm where their fathers and grandfathers
had always worked.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
The Harvest Home
</div>

<p class="new_para">In olden days, harvest time was the great social season
of the year on the farm, when master and man worked and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
rejoiced together in common bonds of fellowship, and finally
celebrated the festival of the Harvest Home as one family.
Tusser thus describes the old-time harvest:</p>

<p class="new_para">The principal reaper was in some districts named the
<em>harvest-lord</em> (<abbr title="Lincolnshire">Lin.</abbr> <abbr title="East Anglia">e.An.</abbr>). It was his duty to go first in the
row, and to regulate the motions of the rest of the band.
Tusser, who was an Essex man, says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="p_line"><span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Grant haruest lord more by a penie or twoo,</span></div>

  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p class="cont">Next to him came the <em>harvest-lady</em>, the second reaper, who
took the <em>harvest-lord’s</em> place if the latter were absent. In
Shropshire the last man of the whole band was termed the
<em>lag-man</em>. Often three or four reapers would each take
a ridge and compete with one another as to who should finish
first. This was called <em>kemping</em> (<abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr> <abbr title="Ireland">Irel.</abbr> <abbr title="north Country">n.Cy.</abbr>). The <em>largess</em>
was a gift of money demanded by the reapers, either during
the harvest or at its conclusion. After receiving it, the
custom was to cry out three times: Halloo largess! This
was the ceremony of <em>crying a largess</em> to which Tusser alludes
in the verse quoted above. It continued to be practised in
parts of East Anglia till the latter half of last century.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
The Last Sheaf of Wheat
</div>

<p class="new_para">When the reaping of the last cornfield was all but finished,
a small patch of grain was left standing. It was then tied
at the top with a piece of ribbon, or the stalks were roughly
plaited together, to form a sheaf, and then the reapers placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
themselves a few yards off, and threw their sickles at it,
competing for the honour of winning the <em>last cut</em>. This last
handful to be reaped was the trophy of the harvest-home
feast. It was frequently dressed up to appear like a rude
human figure, gaily decorated, and carried home in triumph.
Afterwards it was usually placed above the door of the farm-kitchen,
or over the chimney-piece, to remain there throughout
the winter to bring good luck, and ward off witchcraft.
The ceremonies connected with this last sheaf, and the names
by which it was known varied in different places. It was
called: the ben (<abbr title="East Anglia">e.An.</abbr>); cailleach (<abbr title="Ireland">Irel.</abbr>); churn or kirn
(<abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr> <abbr title="Ireland">Irel.</abbr> <abbr title="north Country">n.Cy.</abbr>); claaick-sheaf (<abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr>); cripple-goat (<abbr title="Isle">I.</abbr> of
Skye); frog (<abbr title="Worcestershire">Wor.</abbr>); gilach (<abbr title="Ireland">Irel.</abbr>); granny (<abbr title="Ireland">Irel.</abbr>); hare
(<abbr title="Ireland">Irel.</abbr> <abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr>); maiden (<abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr>); mell (<abbr title="north Country">n.Cy.</abbr>); or when made up
into a figure it was: the corn-baby; kirn-baby; kirn-doll;
mell-doll; harvest-queen. But perhaps the best-known
name of all is the south-west-Country <em>neck</em>, a term originally
borrowed from Scandinavia, <abbr title="compare">cp.</abbr> Norw. and Swed. dial. <em>nek</em>,
a sheaf. Much has been written about the ceremony of
<em>Crying the neck</em>. A full account of it is given in Hunt’s
<cite>Popular Romances of the West of England</cite>, and a long correspondence
on the subject was kept up in the <cite>Western Morning
News</cite> in August 1898. Mrs. Hewitt, writing in 1900, says
the custom ‘still obtains in some parishes in the west of
England’. She describes it thus: ‘When the last sheaf of
wheat is cut at the end of August, the reapers take the very
last handful of straw and plait the ends together, tying
them with lengths of bright-coloured ribbons; then, lifting
it high above their heads, wave their sickles frantically, and
shout:</p>

Crying the Mare
</div>

<p class="cont">
The exact manner of performing the ceremony and the
words used vary in different districts, the variations being
mostly due to the fact that this custom has been blended
together with another called <em>Crying the mare</em> (<abbr title="Ireland">Irel.</abbr> <abbr title="Cheshire">Chs.</abbr> <abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr>
<abbr title="Hertfordshire">Hrt.</abbr>). Indeed, many writers have been hereby led to
confuse these two customs, which were originally quite
distinct. <em>Crying the mare</em> was performed by the farm men
who were first to finish harvest in the neighbourhood. It
was a mode of triumphing over their neighbours by offering
the services of an imaginary mare to help a laggard farmer.
The men assembled in the stackyard, or on some strip of
rising ground, and there divided themselves into two bands,
and chanted in loud voices the following dialogue. First
band: I have her, I have her, I have her. Second band:
What hast thee? (Every sentence is repeated three times.)
A mare. Whose is her? H. B.’s (naming their master whose
corn is all cut). Where shall we send her? To C. D. (naming
some neighbour whose corn is left standing, and who therefore
may be supposed to need the loan of a mare). In parts
of Shropshire it was customary, some sixty or seventy years
ago, actually to send a horse, mounted by the head reaper.</p>

<p class="new_para">The cart carrying home the last load was styled the
Harvest-cart. It was often decked out with ash-boughs and
garlands, whilst on it rode boys singing the traditional song
appropriate to the occasion:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p class="new_para">Then came the harvest-home banquet, the <em>churn-supper</em>,
<em>mell-supper</em>, or <em>hockey</em> (<abbr title="Hertfordshire">Hrt.</abbr> <abbr title="East Anglia">e.An.</abbr>), to which the labourers’
wives and children were also invited. When the feasting
was over, and the usual harvest-songs had been sung, the
rest of the evening was spent in dancing and general rustic
merriment.</p>

<p class="new_para">The day when the farm hands resumed the usual order of

name of Sorrowful Monday.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
Terms relating to Agriculture
</div>

<p class="new_para">Since farming is an industry covering the land, and not
confined to particular districts, like coal-mining or salt-making,
it would be possible to collect several different
series of dialect terms relating to land-tenure, haymaking,
reaping, ploughing, <abbr class="silent" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, each belonging to a specified
geographical area. If we were travelling through the
country at the time of the <em>haysel</em>, or hay-harvest, we should
have to call a hay-cock a hay-cock wherever we met one,
but it might locally be known by the name of a <em>hatchel</em>, a <em>hob</em>,
a <em>jockey-cock</em>, a <em>keil</em>, or a <em>wad</em>, or by some other name equally
unfamiliar to our ears. Or again, later in the season, if we
went into a cornfield and looked at the sheaves set up to
dry, each pile would be a yellow corn-stook and nothing
more to us with our limited vocabulary of the harvest field,
but it might stand there as a <em>hattock</em>, a <em>hile</em>, a <em>kiver</em>, a <em>mair</em>,
a <em>stitch</em>, <abbr class="silent" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, according to the district where it had been
set up.</p>

<p class="new_para">Farm labourers everywhere are accustomed to wear some
sort of rough gaiters to protect their legs from cold and wet,
often it is worsted stockings without feet, which serve this
purpose, especially for walking in snow. The various names
for these gaiters in the different dialects form a curious list.
They are: bams, baffles, bofflers, cockers, galligaskins,
gamashes, hoggers, kitty-bats, loags, martyens, moggans,
scoggers, whirlers, yanks, <abbr class="silent" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr> But one of the biggest lists of
dialect names might be found belonging to the slight refreshment
taken by labourers between meals, either at eleven
o’clock or four in the afternoon. Here is a selection of some
of the names: bagging, bait, bever, clocking, coger, dew-bit,
docky, down-dinner, downdrins, elevens, four-hours, jaw-bit,
lump, nammet, i.e. noon-meat, <abbr title="Old English">O.E.</abbr> <em><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">nōn-mete</span></em>, nocket,
nuncheon, undern.</p>

<p class="new_para">If we turn to the animals on the farm, the sheep in its
various stages of growth and commercial value would
probably be found to possess the largest number of names.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
It would puzzle most people, other than those to the manner
born, to define all the technical terms in use, such as:
chilver, cull, dinmont, gimmer, he-der, shear-hog, wether-hog,
theave, thrinter, twinter, two-tooth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">
Calls to Animals
</div>

<p class="new_para">More interesting, however, than mere names of the
animals are the words used by the farmer and his men in
dealing directly with the beasts under their control. A study
of wagoners’ words raises one’s notion of the intellectual
level of cart-horses considerably. All sorts of exact directions
are conveyed to them through the medium of interjections
such as the following: Boc! Chee-eggin! Come-other-whoa!
Cubba-hoult! Hait! Hap! Har! Hauve!
Joss! Kip! Mather! Mock-mether-hauve! Ree! Ware-whoop!
Weesh! Whet-gee! Wo-cum-huggin! Woor-ree!

Sheep-scoring Numerals
</div>

<p class="new_para">In olden times it was customary among sheep-farmers and
shepherds in the Lake District and in the northern counties
generally, to use Celtic numerals for counting sheep. The
traditional forms varied in different localities, as may be
seen from the various series which have been collected and
put on record by folklorists. The following are the numbers
up to ten formerly in use near Keswick: Yan, tyan, tethera,
methera, pimp, sethera, lethera, hovera, dovera, dick.</p>

<p class="new_para">The custom of counting sheep by means of such numbers
has now been obsolete for about a hundred years, but it is
a curious link with our Celtic predecessors, coming down as
it does so near to our own times. Our Anglo-Saxon forefathers
never amalgamated with the Celts, and the Celtic
language never seriously influenced English. The Celtic loan-words
borrowed by the Anglo-Saxons are comparatively few,
and those few, chiefly names of places and things of no special
importance. From a linguistic point of view it is strange to
find such an everyday implement as a set of numerals persisting
in the spoken speech of a people who hardly knew
another word of the language of which these formed part,
and who of course had their own numerals. It is perhaps
not too romantic an explanation to suggest that among the
few Celts who became subjects to the foreign invaders were
the humble shepherds who had always tended sheep on the
north-country moors and fells. The new settlers would
doubtless find it useful to keep them on in their hereditary
occupation, and in taking over the shepherd, they also took
over his system of numeration, which in his mind was
indissolubly associated with the sheep under his care.</p>

<span class="sub_head">WEIGHTS AND MEASURES</span></h2>

<p class="new_para">Anybody who has ever done any practical housekeeping
in a provincial town is familiar with certain anomalies in
the buying and selling of farm produce and other articles in
common use. Why, for instance, is a potato when young
sold by weight, and when it is old by measure? Why are
gooseberries sold by measure and other small fruits by
weight? Why are eggs in Oxford sold at so many to the
shilling, and in Sidmouth for so much the dozen? Still, we
can jog along with our preconceived notions as to the proper
means of apportioning out the goods we want to buy, and
we do not have to readjust or add to the Tables we learned
at school. A catalogue of the weights and measures in the
dialects does however upset a great many of our everyday
ideas, and make our knowledge of Tables seem surprisingly
limited. For here we find familiar measures changing their
standard value according to locality, or according to the
commodity to be sold by measure or weight; all sorts of
new measures with queer names enter into computations
where we had hitherto only dealt with plain bushels, or
pounds, or inches; liquid measures usurp the place of dry,
and vice versa; and indefinite terms like heap, bunch,
bundle become fixed quantities. Let us hope that compilers
of arithmetic books will never be allowed to stray into
this field. What a fiendish joy it would give to those tormentors
of youth if they might add to their nightmare sums
about taps running into leaky baths, and men ploughing
fields by the week, and horses costing odd shillings and
pence, a few questions like this: If one man could plough
an acre of land in Westmorland in five days, working every
other day, how long would six men take to plough a field of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
11½ acres in Cheshire? If a Cornishman bought a mease of
herrings in the Isle of Man and sold them to his next-door
neighbour at home, how many more herrings would he have
left for his wife to fry than if he took them to Clovelly to sell?
If a dish and a half of butter costs two shillings and twopence
halfpenny, how much butter would you get for four shillings
and elevenpence three farthings? Or nice problems on the
Tables such as: If three men and a boy could get thirty-six
pankets of coal in four days and a half, how long would it
take two boys to get out a chalder? If A. bought a wash of
oysters and sold them to B. at so much per strike, what would
be the price of a prickle of whelks?</p>

Variation in Weights and Measures
</div>

<p class="new_para">A gill in most of the north-country dialects means half
a pint, in Devonshire it means a quart, and in Cornwall, as
a measure of tin, it means a pint. A stone may be equivalent
to any weight from 8 <abbr title="pound">lb.</abbr> to 24 <abbr title="pound">lb.</abbr>, it would depend whether
the article in the scales was beef, or butter, or hay, or wool,
and so on. A pound of butter used to weigh 18 <abbr title="ounces">oz.</abbr> throughout
Cheshire. In the Lake District butter was formerly sold
by the <em>long pound</em>, which was equivalent to 22 <abbr title="ounces">oz.</abbr> A Northumbrian
peck is one third of a Winchester bushel, but a
Craven peck is half a Winchester bushel. A hundred may
mean the <em>long hundred</em>, which is usually six score, but in
parts of Worcestershire, by machine weight it is 112 <abbr title="pound">lb.</abbr>, by
count, 126. In Norfolk a hundred crabs is 240, because
crabs are counted by <em>casts</em>, and a <em>cast</em> is a pair of crabs.
According to Brighton measure, 128 herrings make a hundred,
but if it was mackerel there would be 132. An old
Cumberland rhyme gives: Five scwore to t’hundred o’ men,
money, an’ pins; Six scwore to t’hundred o’ other things.
A yard of land in Devonshire is 9 <abbr title="feet">ft.</abbr>, but a Cornish land
yard is 6 <abbr title="yards">yds.</abbr> or 18 <abbr title="feet">ft.</abbr></p>

Local Terms and Customs relating to Weights and Measures

<p class="new_para">A <em>boll</em> is a dry measure of capacity varying from two to six
bushels. At Alnwick, a boll of barley or oats was six bushels;
of wheat two bushels. At Hexham, a boll of barley or of oats

a measure of wheat of which three go to make up two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
bushels. A <em>fother</em> is a cartload, in some places a one-horse
load, and in others a two-horse load. If it denotes a weight
of lead, it is equivalent to 21 cwt. and upwards. In Durham,
as a measure for coals, it meant 17⅔ <abbr title="hundredweight">cwt.</abbr>, <abbr title="compare">cp.</abbr> ‘<span lang="enm" xml:lang="enm">With him ther

a measure for herrings in East Anglia, a last of herrings is
said to be ten thousand, but if six score and twelve go to
each hundred, there would actually be 13,200. A <em>lug</em> (<abbr title="Warwickshire">War.</abbr>
<abbr title="west Country">w.Cy.</abbr>) is a measure of land, usually a rod, pole, or perch, but
occasionally varying in length, <abbr title="compare">cp.</abbr> ‘<span lang="emodeng" xml:lang="emodeng">Eight lugs of grownd</span>,’
Spenser, <cite><abbr title="The Faerie Queene">F. Q.</abbr></cite> <abbr title="Book 2 canto 10 line 11">Bk. II. x. 11</abbr>. A <em>shaftment</em> is the measure of

<p class="new_para">In East Anglia a pint of butter would mean 20 <abbr title="ounces">oz.</abbr> In
parts of Kent fruit, vegetables, and fish are sold by the
quart. Bread also is sold in pecks, gallons, and quarts.
A peck in west Somerset may be used as a measure for cider,
one peck being equal to two gallons. In Cheshire and Staffordshire
pottery is sold by the <em>piece</em>. I have myself bought
flower-pots by this standard, the number of the pots contained
in the piece varying according to their size. Firewood
stacked for sale is in many districts sold by the <em>cord</em>, a
measure varying in amount in different parts of the country.
In Worcestershire and Herefordshire, and parts also of
Shropshire and Gloucestershire, fruit and vegetables are
always sold by the <em>pot</em>, or <em>half-pot</em>; a kind of basket or
hamper without a lid. Hops are sold by the <em>pocket</em>, this
latter being an enormous bag some 7½ <abbr title="feet">ft.</abbr> long, holding about
168 <abbr title="pound">lb.</abbr> of hops. Bottom might still express ‘a great desire

common proverbial saying: To look for a needle in a bottle
of hay is known as far back as 1655. Peck is used figuratively
in the phrase: a peck o’ troubles. A very common
way of telling a Yorkshireman that he is judging or treating
others by his own standard of thought or action is to say he
is: measuring a peck out of his own stroke.</p>

<p class="new_para">Any kind of indefinite measure of anything may of course

<span class="sub_head">PLANT NAMES AND NAMES OF ANIMALS</span></h2>

<p class="new_para">A few of the dialect plant-names have been noticed in
previous chapters in connexion with superstitious beliefs,
medical lore, <abbr class="silent" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>, but there are a great many more, equally
well worth considering. What one feels about them—and
herein lies their chief attraction—is that they reflect the
popular mind, and are not the result of mere peeping and
botanizing. The rustic sees in the flower something which
calls up in his mind a familiar object—a dish of eggs and
bacon, the parson in the pulpit, a hen and chickens; or
something which reminds him of a Bible story he has known
from his childhood; or something akin to human nature,
which draws forth a responsive recognition.</p>

<p class="new_para">We naturally expect to find in the different dialects
different names for one and the same flower, but it is strange
to find up and down the country one and the same name
attached to different flowers. An Oxford lady once pointed
out to me some plants of the double garden daisy, which
she called Bachelor’s Buttons. I declared this was a misnomer,
for the Bachelor’s Buttons I had grown up with in
Herefordshire were some kind of double ranunculus. Subsequent
research, however, supported both sides of the argument,
and showed further, that at least twenty more plants
also bore the name of Bachelor’s Button in different parts of
the country. Even a common name like Honeysuckle is not
restricted to the fragrant climber <span class="sci_name">Lonicera Peryclymenum</span>
with which we of the standard speech always associate it.
The following plants may all be called Honeysuckle: 1. The
purple clover, <span class="sci_name">Trifolium pratense</span>. 2. The white clover,

Plants associated with Biblical Names

Honeysuckle (<abbr title="Cheshire">Chs.</abbr> <abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr>), Virgin Mary’s Milkdrops (<abbr title="Monmouthshire">Mon.</abbr> <abbr title="Wiltshire">Wil.</abbr>),
Lady’s Milk-sile (<abbr title="Cheshire">Chs.</abbr>), are names of the lungwort <span class="sci_name">Pulmonaria
officinalis</span>, referring to the legend that during the flight into
Egypt some of the Blessed Virgin’s milk fell on its leaves, as
she nursed the infant Jesus. The same legend is also told to
account for like spots on the leaves of the Blessed Thistle
(<abbr title="Warwickshire">War.</abbr>), Our Lady’s Thistle, <span class="sci_name">Carduus Marianus</span>. Another
legend says that the Virgin Mary, when thirsty, met with
a cow, and after using the broad leaf of the thistle as a drinking-cup,
willed that the species should ever after be called
by her name, and bear the stains of the milk on its leaves.
The lungwort is also called Mary’s Tears (<abbr title="Dorset">Dor.</abbr>), and the
spots are traced to the tears shed by her at the Crucifixion.
Legend tells that once the Virgin Mary plucked up a root of
the crab’s claw, <span class="sci_name">Polygonum Persicaria</span>, and then threw it
away, saying ‘that’s useless’, hence Useless (<abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr>) has been
its name ever since, and the blotches on its leaves are the

Plants associated with the Bible and with the Christian Seasons
</div>

<p class="new_para">Gethsemane (<abbr title="Cheshire">Chs.</abbr>), the early purple orchis, <span class="sci_name">Orchis mascula</span>,
is said to have been growing at the foot of the Cross, and
to have received drops of blood on its leaves, the marks of
which it has never lost. The same legend is attached also to
the Calvary Clover, <span class="sci_name">Medicago echinus</span>, the leaves of which
are marked with dull red, irregular blotches exactly like real
blood-stains. The plant is much prized as a pot-plant, both
for the sake of its leaves and for its curious seed-vessels, one
of which was given to me a few weeks ago. It looks like
a little prickly ball, and when thoroughly dry it can be
unwound, spiral fashion, in two coils, an outer prickly one,
and an inner smooth one which encases the twelve seeds.
The ends can then be hooked one into the other, to form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
a miniature Crown of Thorns. The seeds, I was told, must
be planted on Ash Wednesday, though probably an older
version of the tradition would give Good Friday as the
fitting date, but I have never heard of the superstition
before. In parts of Cheshire Christ’s Thorn, <span class="sci_name">Crataegus
Pyracantha</span>, is the accredited plant from which the Saviour’s
Crown of Thorns was made. In parts of Yorkshire Christ’s
Thorn is a name of the common holly, with its scarlet berries
typical of His blood. The fame of having been cut to make
the Crown of Thorns was given in Kent to the Jews’ Myrtle,
the butcher’s broom, <span class="sci_name">Ruscus aculeatus</span>. The Eye of Christ
(<abbr title="Wales">Wal.</abbr>) is the germander speedwell, <span class="sci_name">Veronica Chamaedrys</span>,
also known as Angels’ Eyes (<abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr>).</p>

<p class="new_para">The name Aaron’s Beard is applied to several plants; so
is Aaron’s Rod, the latter name being perhaps most commonly

Adam’s Flannel (<abbr title="Yorkshire">Yks.</abbr> <abbr title="Cheshire">Chs.</abbr> <abbr title="Lincolnshire">Lin.</abbr> <abbr title="Northamptonshire">Nhp.</abbr> <abbr title="Warwickshire">War.</abbr>), so called from
the soft, flannel-like appearance of the leaves. The Solomon’s
Seal, <span class="sci_name">Polygonatum multiflorum</span>, is named David’s
Harp, from the resemblance of the long curved flower-stalk
with its pendent blossoms to the harp as it is portrayed in
old pictures, where David is represented playing on an
instrument shaped like half a pointed arch, hung with metal
bells, which he strikes with two hammers. The Drops of
Abel’s Blood (<abbr title="Durham">Dur.</abbr>) are unopened flower-buds of the red
fuchsia; Jacob’s Ladder is a name shared by various plants,
garden-plants, and wild; Joseph’s Flower (<abbr title="Sussex">Sus.</abbr>) is the goat’s

<p class="new_para">The smell of the common buttercup was formerly supposed
to induce madness, hence the name Crazy (<abbr title="Midlands">Midl.</abbr>
<abbr title="west and south-west Country">w. and sw.Cy.</abbr>). In the same way poppies are called Headaches
(<abbr title="Ireland">Irel.</abbr> <abbr title="Midlands">Midl.</abbr> <abbr title="East Anglia">e.An.</abbr>), because it is believed that the smell of

<abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr>), the shepherd’s purse, <span class="sci_name">Capsella Bursa-pastoris</span>, is so
named because it impoverishes the farmer’s land. Children
gather it and repeat: Pick-pocket, penny nail, Put the
rogue in the jail. The same plant is also called Pick your
mother’s heart out (<abbr title="Warwickshire">War.</abbr>), or simply Mother’s Heart (<abbr title="Scotland">Sc.</abbr>
<abbr title="north Country">n.Cy.</abbr> <abbr title="Midlands">Midl.</abbr>). Children play a kind of game with the heart-shaped
seed-pods. They get one another to pick one of these
off, which done, there follows the accusing cry: You’ve picked
your mother’s heart out. In parts of Yorkshire the derisive
cry is: Pick packet to London, You’ll never go to London.
In Dorsetshire Break your mother’s heart is the hemlock,
<span class="sci_name">Conium maculatum</span>; and Pick your mother’s eyes out is the
field speedwell, <span class="sci_name">Veronica agrestis</span>. In the Lake District
certain curative properties are attributed to the Solomon’s
Seal, <span class="sci_name">Polygonatum officinale</span>, whence it is called the Vagabond’s
Friend. It is said to be a remedy for black eyes,
bruises, and broken noses. Courtship and Matrimony (<abbr title="Cumberland">Cum.</abbr>)
is the meadow-sweet, <span class="sci_name">Spiraea Ulmaria</span>, so called from the
scent of the flower before and after bruising, which is thought
to be typical of the two states in life.</p>

<p class="new_para">The hail-fellow-well-met spirit of the rustic towards the
world of Nature and all that is therein, which shows itself
in plant-names like Saucy Betty, is still more noticeable in
his use of personal names for living animals—toads, and even
insects included. According to Dr. Smythe Palmer in his
book on <cite>The Folk and their Word-lore</cite>, some of these names are
due to popular etymology, as for instance, Isaac, the hedge-sparrow,
from <em>hay-suck</em>, <abbr title="Old English">O.E.</abbr> <em><span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">hege-sugge</span></em>, i.e. the hedge-sucker.
In the same way Sweet Alice is said to be a corruption
of <em>sweet allison</em>, <span class="sci_name">Alyssum maritimum</span>. But even if a few
of the names admit of this prosaic derivation, it does but
enhance their interest, by making them proofs of the common
tendency towards individual names.</p>

<p class="new_para">Amongst the names for the common sparrow is Philip (<abbr title="Cheshire">Chs.</abbr>

entitled <cite>A litle boke of Philip Sparrow</cite>, being the lament of
a nun for the untimely death of her pet sparrow, slain by
a cat. The hedge-sparrow is Betty (<abbr title="Warwickshire">War.</abbr>), and Juggy (<abbr title="Nottinghamshire">Not.</abbr>),
the latter name being given also to the wren (<abbr title="Leicestershire">Lei.</abbr> <abbr title="Sussex">Sus.</abbr>). It

Dr. Johnson’s knowledge and love of his native dialect crops
up in his Dictionary occurs under the heading ‘Goldfinch’,
<abbr title="compare">cp.</abbr> ‘Goldfinch.... A singing bird, so named from his
golden colour. This is called in Staffordshire a <em>proud taylor</em>.’
In most of the Midland counties, including Staffordshire, and
in others to the north and south-west, the goldfinch still
bears the name of Proud Tailor. The redstart is Katie
bran’-tail (<abbr title="Shropshire">Shr.</abbr>); the owl is Josey (<abbr title="Worcestershire">Wor.</abbr> <abbr title="Devonshire">Dev.</abbr>); Madge-howlet

pronounced in Oxford Mollern, with the accent on the first

whitecap is Peggy-whitethroat (<abbr title="Northamptonshire">Nhp.</abbr>); the raven is Ralph

Polly-wash-dishes (<abbr title="East Anglia">e.An.</abbr> <abbr title="Dorset">Dor.</abbr> <abbr title="Somerset">Som.</abbr>). It is interesting to
note in connexion with the geographical distribution of this
name in modern times, that Dr. Johnson includes ‘Dish-washer’
in his Dictionary as: ‘The name of a bird,’ without
being able to specify the kind of bird to which it belonged.
No doubt he had heard the name casually, but neither he
nor his Scottish assistants were familiar with its use.</p>

Jeremiah (<abbr title="Suffolk">Suf.</abbr>); Peter Moguz (<abbr title="Cornwall">Cor.</abbr>), <abbr class="silent" title="et cetera">&amp;c.</abbr>; a female donkey
in Lincolnshire is a Jen-ass. A tom-cat in Suffolk is a Jim-cat;
and a she-cat is a Betty-cat. One is tempted to
suggest that this last name is due to association of ideas—the
domestic cat, the fireside, and the kettle singing on the
hob—for in East Anglia the kettle is nicknamed Betty, and
the common proverb takes the form of: That’s the saucepan
calling the kettle Betty Black.</p>

every boy or girl think of what he or she likes best, and
